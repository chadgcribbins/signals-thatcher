# Framework Lens: Hotel Love Drivers & Emotional Attachments

## Objective
Surface and prioritise the specific experiences, feelings, and moments that cause guests to love a hotel, remember it vividly, recommend it unprompted, or return despite cheaper or more convenient alternatives.

This synthesis is responsible for identifying why a hotel matters emotionally, not just what it enables functionally.

The output should explain what people protect, miss, talk about, and feel reluctant to give up when they think about a hotel they love.

## Primary Evidence Sources (Priority Order)
- Memory-based lived experience corpus
  - Knowledge Curator node: Hotel memories (highest weight)
- Long-form interview digests
  - Knowledge Curator node: Customer interviews
- Contextual trend signals
  - Used only to interpret, not originate, love drivers

## Core Question This Framework Answers
“When people say they love a hotel, what are they actually responding to, and why does it stay with them?”

## Unit of Analysis
The core unit is a Love Driver, defined as:

A recurring emotional or experiential factor that creates attachment, fondness, or loyalty toward a hotel, grounded in lived experience and memory.

Love Drivers may be:
- emotional
- sensory
- relational
- symbolic
- situational
- identity reinforcing

They do not need to be rational, efficient, or goal oriented.

## Core Responsibilities of the Synthesis
The synthesis must:
- Identify distinct Love Drivers grounded in lived experience evidence.
- Decide how many Love Drivers to include, prioritising depth and memorability over coverage.
- Merge or discard overlapping drivers where evidence does not justify separation.
- Articulate why each Love Driver matters emotionally, not just what it is.
- Explicitly surface ambiguity, contradictions, or uneven evidence.

## Weighting & Emphasis Rules (Mandatory)
- Love Drivers strongly evidenced in Hotel memories must be prioritised, even if they appear inefficient, indulgent, or impractical.
- Drivers that appear only in trends but not in lived experience should be treated with scepticism and may be excluded.
- If a Love Driver is irrational, nostalgic, or identity based, this must be made explicit rather than sanitised.
- When a specific memory materially shapes a Love Driver, quote or closely paraphrase it and reference the contributor by name to show lineage.
- These are reasoning preferences, not factual claims.

## Love Driver Structure (Required Fields)
For each Love Driver, populate the following sections:

### 1. Love Driver Statement
A concrete, human, emotionally recognisable description.

Written as:
- “People love this hotel because it makes them feel…”
- “People become attached to this hotel when…”

Avoid abstract hospitality language unless the evidence demands it.

### 2. Emotional Payoff
What emotional state or feeling this driver reliably creates.

Examples:
- relief
- being seen
- quiet pride
- belonging
- permission to slow down
- feeling worldly
- feeling taken care of without being managed

### 3. Situational Triggers
The moments or contexts where this Love Driver becomes most salient.

Examples:
- first arrival
- late night return
- morning routine
- interaction with staff
- moments of stress or vulnerability

### 4. Evidence Anchors
Cite supporting evidence using disciplined labels:
- [EVIDENCE] direct memory, quote, or interview insight
- [INFERENCE] synthesis across multiple memories
- [JUDGMENT] interpretation where evidence is partial

Where possible, include named memory holders, for example:
“[EVIDENCE] Sarah describes choosing this hotel again because ‘they remembered my coffee order and didn’t make a thing of it.’”

### 5. What People Would Miss If It Was Gone
Describe the sense of loss if this Love Driver disappeared.

This helps distinguish core attachment from nice-to-haves.

### 6. Tensions or Trade-offs
Surface any conflicts this Love Driver introduces.

Examples:
- comfort vs novelty
- intimacy vs scale
- predictability vs surprise
- luxury vs authenticity

### 7. Confidence Level
State confidence explicitly:
- High confidence
- Medium confidence
- Low confidence

Include a brief explanation of why.

## Synthesis-Level Requirements
Across all Love Drivers, the synthesis must:
- Limit total Love Drivers, typically 8 to 12 unless evidence strongly supports more.
- Implicitly or explicitly prioritise drivers by emotional weight and evidence density.
- Show where different Love Drivers reinforce or undermine each other.
- Leave space unfinished where evidence is thin or contradictory.

## Desired Effect
The output should:
- Feel unmistakably grounded in real people and real memories.
- Prompt recognition, debate, and disagreement among hotel teams.
- Make it uncomfortable to reduce the hotel to amenities or star ratings.
- Reveal what is emotionally fragile or sacred about the experience.

Polite completeness is not the goal.

Credible, resonant insight is.

## Confidence & Limitations
Where appropriate, the synthesis should:
- Distinguish memory-led attachment from trend-influenced expectations.
- Flag where additional memory collection would materially change conclusions.
- Avoid over-rationalising emotional drivers into operational language.

## How This Differs From JTBD (Explicitly)
JTBD asks: What progress is the guest making?

This framework asks: Why does this place matter to them?
