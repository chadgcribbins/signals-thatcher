# Framework Lens: Emotional Attachments (Love and Hate Drivers)

## Objective
Surface and prioritise the specific experiences, feelings, and moments that cause guests to love a hotel, remember it vividly, recommend it unprompted, or return despite cheaper or more convenient alternatives. Also surface what they actively resent, avoid, or warn others about.

This synthesis is responsible for identifying why a hotel matters emotionally, not just what it enables functionally.

The output should explain what people protect, miss, talk about, and feel reluctant to give up, as well as what they refuse to tolerate.

## Overall Goal
Clarify the emotional drivers to protect and the aversions to avoid, so teams know what creates loyalty and what breaks it.

## Primary Evidence Sources (Priority Order)
1. Hotel Memories
2. Industry Leaders Podcasts
3. Concierge Interview
4. Trend reports
5. Essence of our brand

## Core Question This Framework Answers
“When people say they love a hotel, what are they actually responding to, what do they hate when it goes wrong, and why does it stay with them?”

## Unit of Analysis
The core unit is a Love Driver, defined as:

A recurring emotional or experiential factor that creates attachment, fondness, or loyalty toward a hotel, grounded in lived experience and memory.

A Hate Driver (or Aversion) is:

A recurring emotional or experiential factor that creates dislike, avoidance, or active rejection, grounded in lived experience and memory.

Love Drivers may be:
- emotional
- sensory
- relational
- symbolic
- situational
- identity reinforcing

They do not need to be rational, efficient, or goal oriented.

## Core Responsibilities of the Synthesis
The synthesis must:
- Identify distinct Love Drivers grounded in lived experience evidence.
- Surface recurring Hate Drivers where evidence supports them.
- Decide how many Love Drivers to include, prioritising depth and memorability over coverage.
- Merge or discard overlapping drivers where evidence does not justify separation.
- Articulate why each Love Driver matters emotionally, not just what it is.
- Explicitly surface ambiguity, contradictions, or uneven evidence.

## Weighting & Emphasis Rules (Mandatory)
- Weight evidence in the order listed above.
- Hotel memories should be quoted or closely paraphrased where they materially illuminate a driver; reference the person's name to show lineage.
- Love Drivers strongly evidenced in Hotel Memories must be prioritised, even if they appear inefficient, indulgent, or impractical.
- Drivers that appear only in trends but not in lived experience should be treated with scepticism and may be excluded.
- If a Love Driver is irrational, nostalgic, or identity based, this must be made explicit rather than sanitised.
- If a Hate Driver is present, state it directly rather than softening the language.
- These are reasoning preferences, not factual claims.

## Love Driver Structure (Required Fields)
For each Love Driver, populate the following sections:

### 1. Love Driver Statement
A concrete, human, emotionally recognisable description.

Written as:
- “People love this hotel because it makes them feel…”
- “People become attached to this hotel when…”

Avoid abstract hospitality language unless the evidence demands it.

### 2. Emotional Payoff
What emotional state or feeling this driver reliably creates.

Examples:
- relief
- being seen
- quiet pride
- belonging
- permission to slow down
- feeling worldly
- feeling taken care of without being managed

### 3. Situational Triggers
The moments or contexts where this Love Driver becomes most salient.

Examples:
- first arrival
- late night return
- morning routine
- interaction with staff
- moments of stress or vulnerability

### 4. Evidence Anchors
Cite supporting evidence using disciplined labels:
- [EVIDENCE] direct memory, quote, or interview insight
- [INFERENCE] synthesis across multiple memories
- [JUDGMENT] interpretation where evidence is partial

Where possible, include named memory holders, for example:
“[EVIDENCE] Sarah describes choosing this hotel again because ‘they remembered my coffee order and didn’t make a thing of it.’”

### 5. What People Would Miss If It Was Gone
Describe the sense of loss if this Love Driver disappeared.

This helps distinguish core attachment from nice-to-haves.

### 6. Tensions or Trade-offs
Surface any conflicts this Love Driver introduces.

Examples:
- comfort vs novelty
- intimacy vs scale
- predictability vs surprise
- luxury vs authenticity

### 7. Confidence Level
State confidence explicitly:
- High confidence
- Medium confidence
- Low confidence

Include a brief explanation of why.

### 8. Hate Counterpart (If Evidenced)
Describe the inverse experience that produces active dislike or avoidance, with evidence anchors and the specific language guests use.

## Synthesis-Level Requirements
Across all Love Drivers, the synthesis must:
- Limit total Love Drivers, typically 8 to 12 unless evidence strongly supports more.
- Implicitly or explicitly prioritise drivers by emotional weight and evidence density.
- Show where different Love Drivers reinforce or undermine each other.
- Leave space unfinished where evidence is thin or contradictory.
- Make the love/hate contrast visible when it shapes decision-making.

## Desired Effect
The output should:
- Feel unmistakably grounded in real people and real memories.
- Prompt recognition, debate, and disagreement among hotel teams.
- Make it uncomfortable to reduce the hotel to amenities or star ratings.
- Reveal what is emotionally fragile or sacred about the experience.
- Surface what guests will defend and what they will not forgive.

Polite completeness is not the goal.

Credible, resonant insight is.

## Confidence & Limitations
Where appropriate, the synthesis should:
- Distinguish memory-led attachment from trend-influenced expectations.
- Flag where additional memory collection would materially change conclusions.
- Avoid over-rationalising emotional drivers into operational language.

## How This Differs From JTBD (Explicitly)
JTBD asks: What progress is the guest making?

This framework asks: Why does this place matter to them, and what makes them reject it?
