# Framework Lens: JTBD with Evidence

## Objective
Define the guest's progress, motivations, and tensions with explicit evidence labeling, grounded in the highest-weight sources available.

## Overall Goal
Produce a clear, evidence-weighted job narrative that guides priorities and decision-making.

## Primary Evidence Sources (Priority Order)
1. Hotel Memories
2. Industry Leaders Podcasts
3. Concierge Interview
4. Trend reports
5. Essence of our brand

## Core Question This Framework Answers
"What progress is the guest trying to make, and what forces shape that progress?"

## Unit of Analysis
A JTBD profile: job statement, motivations, forces of progress, and desired outcomes, with labeled claims.

## Weighting & Emphasis Rules (Mandatory)
- Weight evidence in the order listed above.
- Hotel memories should be quoted or closely paraphrased where they materially illuminate a job; reference the person's name to show lineage.
- These are reasoning preferences, not factual claims.

## Synthesis Output (Example)
This example illustrates a JTBD-only synthesis grounded in the evidence hierarchy above.

## Jobs To Be Done: The Heritage Luxury Quest

### Job Statement
**When** I am planning a significant multi-generational trip or a "once-in-a-lifetime" escape,  
**I want to** immerse myself in a property with deep historical significance and unique local perspective,  
**so I can** cultivate a personal legacy and feel a sense of belonging that transcends a standard transaction.

### Motivations
- **Functional:** Seeking "luxury hacks" (points, elite perks) to maintain high-end standards amidst rising costs [EVIDENCE].
- **Emotional:** A desire to feel "seen and heard" and to escape the "beige-ification" of standardized, Instagram-driven design [EVIDENCE].
- **Social:** Establishing status through "insider access" and private networks that unlock non-commoditized experiences [EVIDENCE].

### Opportunities
- **When:** Planning "Fam Adventures" where Gen Z/Millennial parents prioritize "quality time" (89%) over childcare (24%) [EVIDENCE].
- **Where:** Destinations that act as "conduits" to local culture (e.g., Shoreditch, Mexico City) rather than isolated "islands" [EVIDENCE].
- **How:** Utilizing travel advisors as "power brokers" to navigate "algorithmic fatigue" and "tab overload" [EVIDENCE].

### Capabilities
- **Can:** Use GenAI for "loose-framing" itineraries and "painting a story" of a property's atmosphere [EVIDENCE].
- **Can’t:** Verify the "soul" or "vibe" of a property through digital tools alone; requires human validation or "mystery shopping" [INFERENCE].

### Desired Outcomes
- **Success Criteria:** The stay feels "distinct" and tied to the destination's unique point of view [EVIDENCE].
- **Success Criteria:** Returning "regenerated and rewired" through longevity-focused wellness or "self-cultivation" [EVIDENCE].

### Forces of Progress
- **Push:** "Beige-ification" (standardization); "algorithmic fatigue"; declining CX scores in the leisure sector [EVIDENCE].
- **Pull:** "Heritage Luxury"; "F**k-it List" spontaneity; "Community Capital" and longevity networks [EVIDENCE].
- **Anxieties:** Data privacy (55% deterrent); "trust deficit" caused by AI-generated fake reviews; fear of "servitude" vs. "service" [EVIDENCE].
- **Habits:** Loyalty to established "lifelines" (Marriott, Hilton) for quality assurance despite a desire for "quirky" alternatives [EVIDENCE].

## Knowledge Quality Assessment

### Truth/Accuracy
- The data accurately reflects a "steep decline" in guest satisfaction across all tiers post-COVID [EVIDENCE].
- Financial metrics (RevPAR, CAGR) are grounded in SEC filings and STR data, though geographic reporting variance exists [EVIDENCE].

### Interpretation
- The job framing highlights a tension between irreverent brand cues and expectations for elegant, anticipatory service [INFERENCE].
- The "Belonging Gap" (84% potential vs. 24% actual) is a critical interpretive framework for 2025 [EVIDENCE].

### Sense-Making
- The synthesis connects the "F**k-it List" (spontaneity) with legacy-seeking travel, revealing a fundamental conflict in 2025 traveler psychology [INFERENCE].
- The transition from "Search and Click" to "Agentic Execution" is identified as the primary technological shift [EVIDENCE].

## Conflicts
- **"Irreverence" vs. "Elegance"** — Travelers associate Acme with "rock and roll" but doubt its ability to provide "elegant" anticipatory service — Sources: [AVR-Participant 1], [JOR-Participant 1].
- **"Spontaneity" vs. "Legacy"** — The "F**k-it List" mentality of immediate gratification conflicts with longer-horizon, meaning-heavy travel — Sources: [Virtuoso/Globetrender].
- **"AI Efficiency" vs. "Human Essence"** — 63% of travelers demand human-first service, yet 88% say AI-enabled services are important — Sources: [Future:Poll™], [Global Leisure Perspectives].
- **"Digital ID Benefits" vs. "Privacy Deterrents"** — Digital wallets enable the "connected trip" but 55% of guests are deterred by data sharing — Sources: [Phocuswright], [Future:Poll™].

## Unknowns / Contested Points
- **GenAI Hallucination Risks:** While "genericism" is noted, specific technical data on the frequency of "hallucinations" in luxury concierge contexts is missing [EVIDENCE].
- **Acme’s US Consistency:** High-frequency travelers express doubt about Acme’s ability to maintain consistency in the US market compared to its UK "flagship" roots [EVIDENCE].
- **The "Belonging" Solution:** While the "gap" is documented, the specific operational "hardware" required to bridge it remains speculative [INFERENCE].

## Labeled Claims
- Acme is perceived as an "irreverent" brand with record-label heritage [EVIDENCE].
- This "irreverence" creates a trust gap for travelers seeking elegant, anticipatory service [INFERENCE].
- 74% of luxury travelers seek deep historical significance over "Instagram-worthy" trends [EVIDENCE].
- The "belonging gap" stands at 60 points (84% expectation vs. 24% reality) [EVIDENCE].
- "Agentic AI" will shift staff from administrative "clutter" to "experiential hosting" [INFERENCE].
- 55% of guests are deterred from using services if identifiable info is shared with third parties [EVIDENCE].
- Gen Z and Millennial parents prioritize "quality time" (89%) over childcare (24%) in multi-gen travel [EVIDENCE].
- The "F**k-it List" represents a shift toward spontaneous, frivolous, and liberating experiences [EVIDENCE].
- Spontaneous gratification may erode commitment to deeper, legacy-seeking stays [JUDGMENT].
- Acme has "earned permission" to be playful, but must "know the way back" to its core ethos [JUDGMENT].

## Recommendations
- [STRONG] **Bridge the "Belonging Gap"** by activating "Community Capital" through niche knowledge hubs and longevity networks rather than just social programming [JUDGMENT].
- [MODERATE] **Codify Brand Fundamentals into AI** to prevent "genericism" and ensure agentic AI reflects the "irreverent" yet "anticipatory" brand voice [JUDGMENT].
- [STRONG] **Prioritize "Hardware" Fundamentals** (beds, power outlets, water quality) as these are the primary "trust-breakers" that lead to permanent blacklisting [JUDGMENT].
- [WEAK] **Implement a "Check-in Ritual"** (e.g., a low-stakes lottery) to lean into the "British Quirk" advantage for the US market [JUDGMENT].
