## Leigh

The smell of freshly cooked bread wafted the room as Leigh settled down on to the bright fabric chair for her breakfast, The waiter,' dressed in smart attire greeted her with her with a latte the same has he did every morning after her first visit. She wandered over to the buffet to see the array of vibrant, delicious fresh food that was on offer, fresh fruit locally sourced a real treat and fresh bread made in the kitchen that was still warm, so the butter instantly melted once put on.

Upon returning to her table, she felt the warming on her back as she took her first bite, thinking to herself that this is what life should feel like.

In the background she could hear the early morning swimmers in the pool gently splashing around while they did their laps before the pool got invade by morning aerobics, something leigh always participated in but only in the afternoons as the days suns warmed the pool up so not a shock to her system when she got in.

Not wanting to move from this moment Leigh steps away from the table and thanks the waiter as she heads back to her room to get ready for a blissful day that awaited her, hours of lounging on the golden beach with the sun glistening on the water .

## Sam

It was a cold wintery January night; Sam had just finished his split shift working at The West Bay Hotel where he and his partner Tess were the tenants. Romy their daughter was asleep in her bedroom, Tess who at this time was 4 months pregnant, had tried to wait up to greet Sam but had fallen asleep as well. Sam quietly crawled into bed to get some well earnt rest.

All 3 deep in sleep were startled to the fire alarm raging. Startled Sam sprang from the bed checked his watch, 2.38am. Quickly thinking have we got any planned fire alarm tests. As he walked along the old creaky landing of their flat above the pub, Sam investigated Romy's bedroom only to his horror to see a bright orange glow coming from outside of her window.

Sam shouted for Tess and told her to get Romy and get downstairs to the assembly point, Sam mind was racing at 100mph, first thing he had to manage was the guests staying in the hotel, He had 4 couples staying in the hotel, so he needed to get them up and out of their rooms. Considering the shouting, banging on the doors and the fire alarm one room was still not answering the door. Sam had no option but to get the keys from the bar to get into the room. The orange glow now gathering momentum and panic setting in with this room in mind, Sam managed to get into the room only to find there was no one inside.

In a frenzy Sam ran outside to the assembly point whilst calling the fire brigade, worried about these 2 guests Sam performed a head count, to his amazement they were all present and accounted for. The couple had been quick when they heard the alarms going off and had seen the fire notice on the back of the door and made a swift exit.

Fire crew no onsite, they identified the tumbler dryer was the culprit! After all the madness Sam had become rather embarrassed as he had now realised, he was stood in the car park on a freezing cold night in January wearing nothing but Tess's dressing gown!

## Izzie

As Izzie walked towards the hotel in the blistering midday heat, she climbed the steps to the hotel entrance where huge glass doors slid open, allowing her to step inside into the cool air-conditioned foyer.  Dragging her suitcase across the white marble reception floor, Izzie looked around at the large colourful abstract paintings that stood out against the neutral-coloured walls, soft chairs and sofas were positioned for guests to wait and relax, huge potted plants added a touch of greenery against the stark décor.

Ahead of her, a queue of people were waiting to be checked in, their bags and suitcases gathered around them.

As Izzie stood in line, waiting her turn, her eyes were drawn to the huge windows overlooking the outdoors. Beyond the glass, the sky was a vivid blue, not a cloud in sight, the sun was beating down on a large, oval-shaped swimming pool, its crystal-clear water was occupied with children, laughing as they played splashing around. Music drifted through the air as adults relaxed, some chatting with drinks in hand, others stretched out on sun loungers, eyes closed soaking up the rays from the mid-afternoon sun, Izzie thought how relaxed and carefree everyone looked. It all looked so vibrant.

As Izzie edged closer to the reception desk, she noticed a pale blue pool bar. Not far from it, a little boy stood red-faced, tears streaming down his cheeks, his eyes fixed on the empty cone clutched in his small hand. At his feet lay a melting puddle of pink ice cream. For a moment, it seemed as though no one noticed. Then suddenly, a woman hurried over and replaced the ice cream. The boy's tears slowed, and as the new ice-cream was placed in his hand, a wide grin spread across his face.

As Izzie stood watching she was suddenly aware that the queue had moved and it was her turn to be checked in.

## Simon

### A Roaring Adventure: Our Night with Lions

What started as an ordinary week quickly turned into something unforgettable. Simon had a milestone birthday coming up, and his wife insisted he book Friday off. Simon wasn't a fan of surprises, but curiosity won—and by Thursday, the secret was out: a trip to the West Midlands Safari Park and an overnight stay in the Lion Lodge!

The excitement was electric. The kids thought it was just a day at the safari, and Simon loved keeping the surprise under wraps. Spring had draped the day in a light drizzle, but nothing could dampen the thrill of seeing exotic animals up close. The family laughed, answered endless questions about zebras and rhinos, and even braved rollercoasters in the afternoon. But as the drizzle turned to steady rain, spirits began to dip—until the big reveal.

Back at reception, Simon and Carmen dropped the bombshell: "We're not going home tonight… we're staying in the Lion Lodge!" The boys' faces flickered between delight and dread. "Is that safe?" they asked nervously. Simon wasn't entirely sure himself!

The gates loomed ahead—massive black wrought iron, swinging open like the entrance to Jurassic Park. Rain lashed down as they hurried along a stone path to a rustic wooden door. The air smelled of damp wood and wild animals. Inside, the lodge was pure magic: warm, dim lighting, authentic safari décor, two cozy bedrooms, a lounge, and an outdoor swing—all framed by floor-to-ceiling windows looking straight into the lion enclosure.

Dinner was waiting, bags neatly placed, and Simon cracked open a perfectly chilled cider as the family explored. Outside, lions lounged lazily, but every so often, a massive predator would stroll past the glass—just inches away. The boys shrieked with excitement as golden eyes locked onto them through two inches of glass. For a moment, it felt like the lions were sizing them up for dinner!

Night fell, and with no curtains, the enclosure melted into darkness. That's when the real show began. The lions came alive, their thunderous roars shaking the night air. Simon and his family sat wide-eyed, listening to the primal symphony until sleep finally claimed them in broken intervals. Now they understood why lions nap all day—they party all night!

Morning brought a knock at the door and the heavenly aroma of fresh bread and a cooked breakfast. As they savoured their meal and watched these majestic beasts one last time, reality crept back in. But the memory of that night—the thrill, the awe, the closeness to nature—would stay forever.

## Paul

As the plane from Bristol touched down at Václav Havel Airport, Paul peered through the airplane window, watching delicate snowflakes swirl beneath the floodlights. It was 9pm, Prague's winter night had settled in, and the unfamiliar noises of a new country filled his ears as he stepped onto the tarmac. Paul's breath clouded in the cold, and a flutter of nerves mingled with excitement. He'd never set foot in the Czech Republic before, and now he was here, starting a new adventure for FSC, ready to lead a project that could shape the next chapter of his career.

The Holiday Inn Prague Airport was just a short walk from the terminal, its modern glass façade glowing invitingly through the darkness. Inside, warmth and soft lighting replaced the chill, and the friendly receptionist greeted Paul in fluent English. The lobby's open design felt both futuristic and welcoming, a gentle reassurance that he could find comfort even far from home.

As Paul checked in, he felt a surge of anticipation. The room was spotless, with a room service menu and blackout curtains promising a good night's rest. Yet, as he unpacked, Paul couldn't help but feel the weight of responsibility. He was here not just as a visitor, but as a representative from the UK, tasked with building new relationships and navigating unknown territory.

Looking out of the window at the snow-dusted surroundings with a Shell forecourt glowing magnificently on the airport access road, Paul realised that every journey begins with a single, uncertain step. Tonight, Prague was a blank page, and he was ready to write the next chapter of his story.

## Philip

Philip took a deep breath, and the door lock clicked open with jolt. It was always the moment he feared most when entering a hotel room and didn't have a good feeling on this one. He braced himself as his wife and son entered the room.

Just moments earlier, they'd made what could only be described as a celebrity entrance. The staff had been giddy with excitement, apparently they had never had a Brit stay before, even his driving license had caused hilarity, and as for their accents… It was like royalty had descended into the indiscriminate place just off Highway 59, Mississippi.

The next moment felt inevitable - the smell hit first, a fog of damp fused with the synthetic citrus of LemGel cleaning agent failing to smoother the aroma. The stain flashes on the sheets conjured up images that made him shudder. Not to mention the array of dead insects that looked like they'd fought a good battle, and lost. The fallout began. The walk of shame with heavy bags in tow, back past the receptionist who continued to wave sweetly, back to the red Chevrolet in the parking lot and back to the open road knowing that 3.4 on booking.com could never, ever, be set as the benchmark again.

## Rob

Sometimes the best experiences are the unexpected ones. Rob had decided on the location (Scotland) and the date but left it until the day before to book his accommodation. He went with a brand name he knew of and had experienced before and a price which felt acceptable. The "house" in the name should've given it away.

Rob reaches the entrance at nighttime, a long-swept driveway led him through a wooded carpark on a driveway clearly built to make the most of the surroundings. It slowly reveals a reflection of the moon off the loch, he didn't know it was by a Loch. The driveway drops close to the Loch and meanders back on itself to what looks like the hotel.

The road turns to a pale maroon, red colour, as if it's the mall leading up to Buckingham Palace except this is a turning circle at the front of the hotel. Rob pulls his vehicle up outside in a dodgy old Peugeot 206. The hotel valet opens the car door, he's wearing a traditional kilt and clearly has well-appointed vernacular. Rob hands over the keys with an apology, he's sure the valet has driven better vehicles before.

In front of him is a foreboding Scottish stately house two white plaster sides to the main frontage then a central local stoned centre, it looks as though it should be a Scottish Laird's home. An array of traditional tweeded employees direct him to the front desk past a crackling open fire, tartan carpet meets soft limestone flooring. Somehow the traditional feel also feels very modern, behind the front desk is a backlit picture, it's almost animated, not a TV – it's clearly a picture behind the front desk. Everything smells new, that new fabric / leather smell but with the sweet scent of a wood fire. Welcome Sir, we have your room ready. He knew the hotel would be acceptable, but the good feeling washed over him like relief. Scotland, we've arrived!
