### 4. You were in charge of helping to train general managers at Filters (9:11)

A really great GM has a huge influence on the whole team at Filters. We give key people a little bit of ownership stake in the business. People is everything in what we actually do. It would just be wonderful if we could get people to stay a bit longer.


### 5. Crystal and I started looking for a hotel in 1996 (13:24)

It took us three years before we finally settled on Cotswold High. We were wanting to have a much more contemporary feel about the property. Now 20 years on, it's a very different business but it is the individuality of what we actually do.


### 6. Jukes has four boutique hotels and has developed over the years (16:57)

Jukes has four hotels across the UK. Has your approach to the design or even the feel of the hotels changed over the years? Are there any similarities between all the properties as well as being quite unique to themselves?

There's probably lots of listeners who would love to emulate the journey that you've been on. Making the move from more kind of corporate structures to owning and operating their own hotels. What advice would you give to somebody that would be looking to emulate what you've done?


### 9. You left corporate to go into boutique hotel management (35:05)

I think it was probably of realizing, you know, I've been a general manager. I like to be able to see and do something and see the effect of what I, the decisions I make would have on a business. What's next for Kaleidoscope? What's in the plans over the next year or so?


### 10. It's a tricky time at this moment in time in the business (37:56)

It's been a tough year for most hoteliers. We have a couple of assets that we could sell. But instead of going out and buying something, we'll be holding on to what we've got. Hopefully, those kind of brighter skies are ahead.


### 11. What is one waste material your business uses that you wish you could reuse (40:21)

Thanks for joining us.

**C** (1:36): You're very welcome. Nice to be here.

**B** (1:39): So, for our listeners who, you know, the minority that may not know who you are, can you tell us a bit about how you got into hospitality and maybe take us through. Yeah. Your career journey so far.

**C** (1:50): Sure. So my name is Ian Taylor and I was born in Northern Ireland and I grew up on a farm. So all my family on both mother and father's side are all farmers. And so I'm the oddball that has actually got into hospitality and I suppose where did that really all start? I think as a youngster or a young person we were always given jobs on the farm. So like before we went to school we had to clean out the hen house and then we also had like cattle which needed feeding, et cetera. And I think as a young guy we used to go on family holidays and I was very intrigued when we stayed in a hotel. How does this whole thing actually work? We were in Donegal and I looked and thought, how did these people all get fed roughly at the same time? And then my grandmother, she actually used to employ me to help her on the family, on the family farm to actually do the spring cleaning of her house. And I was always quite good at sort of been able to take things, I rearrange them and I suppose it's a combination of those sort of things. I, I suppose did I really want to do farming? Probably not. So it came really when I was at, when I did my O levels and deciding really what the next thing. And I suppose when I had career adv, I was very intrigued to want to go to Strathclyde University and study hospitality. So that was always an aspirational thing. And then I made the decision that probably I should start off and go into catering and I went to a college in Port Rush and did an OND and did that for two years and then I went and I worked in Switzerland for a year and in a five star hotel, the Grand Hotel national and Lucerne. And I actually loved that, that and it was really my. And I look back on that with very fond memories of saying this is really where I got the taste for what a five star hotel looked like. I came back after doing a year and I did two further years at Manchester doing an HC ARM AP and then from there I joined Bass, which had the Crest Hotel division and was a management trainee and I worked my way through 17 years. I actually like after, in, in 17 years I held many different roles. So after being a trainee then I got a, a couple of roles as assistant managers and like my first hotel job was managing Gloucester Crest and from there I moved, I opened the Holiday Inn Hotel in Sutton, then I had an opportunity to go to Cambridge and then my last role within baths and InterContinental Hotels was running the Crime Plaza Hotel at Heathrow. And from there I, my wife and I, Krista, we decided we should do our own business and that is, we've been at that for the last 25 years and running our own hotels and throughout that 25 years we've owned. This is. We've got like nine hotels, we sold five and currently have got four hotels. Currently.

**B** (5:52): Yeah, amazing. So, yeah, I think we'll get a bit onto the kaleidoscope in a sec. But I just wanted to hone back on, on some of those roles that you had over the years and, and maybe what were some kind of memorable moments or lessons along the way. I imagine, you know, being the GM of a hotel near Heathrow can be quite Eventful, but yeah, even among other roles. What do you think were some of the maybe major moments that maybe formed, you know, the rest of your career and maybe give some insight into, you know, how Kaleidoscope was born as well?

**C** (6:25): Yeah, definitely. Heathrow, it was. It was our top performing hotel in Europe. Like we were 400 rooms and when I was there we had added another 83 rooms. And that hotel was a Holiday Inn and it was being rebranded as a crime plaza. And I was very much part of that team involved in the re branding of it. I was also very instrumental when I was in the corporate world in the development and training side. And I was picked as one of the managers. We used to do management training and with a couple of other colleagues, I actually was responsible for training general managers in assistance right across Europe. And like, I think one of the things I really learned and really developed was how to really get a good grip in managing people, how to really understand others and like, what it really meant to lead a big team. But Heathrow was special in that it was a great team. And I think one of the things that I feel very strongly about in anything we do is the quality of the people that are fundamental if you actually want to run a really good business. I was also involved when I was at Heathrow in introducing revenue management into all the holiday or the Grand Plaza properties of the selection and training of those people. And quite a lot on the branding side of the standards. And I really loved just the variety of the work that we had in that, the scale. Like, you know, you had a. I had a very big team. And so when you move out of that environment and then you actually come and our first role was. Or the first property we bought was Cotswold Heights and Chipping Camden. It was a 15 bedroom hotel. So. And I think after week one, I thought, my God, this is the biggest mistake I've ever made in my career. Like, suddenly, how do you actually like. Or you. You're used to having so many people that can help out and do. And then here you are on the coal face and the boiler fails and people. There's no hot water. What do you do?

**B** (9:08): Yeah, I can imagine.

**C** (9:10): Yeah.

**B** (9:11): And, yeah, before again diving into kind of maybe what helped shape Kaleidoscope, I just wanted to hone in on what you said there about, you know, being in charge of helping to train general managers across the company at the time, just to peek behind the curtain a little bit. What do you think makes a really great GM kind of. What were you Maybe honing in on and imparting towards, you know, during the training process. And in your opinion, what makes a great gm?

**C** (9:40): Yeah, I think for a really great gm, they have. It's, it's. They have a skill set of being able to do, but they also have a competency set. So, like, how well are these people actually driven? And I think the competency we had was achievement drive. Can these people set their own independent goals? How creative are they in coming up with new ideas of how revenue is generated, the customer service orientation, like, how much emphasis did they play? Because I see that a really great GM has a huge influence on the whole team at Filters, right from the top all the way down. And if that person is missing in quite a few, then it can be really, really difficult. But if they're really driven and they've got a strong vision of where the business wants to go, it just makes such a huge difference. And one of the things that I was very keen when we did our own properties, we didn't necessarily do it first of all at Cotswold Highs, but I think we learned from Cotswold Highs was where we give key people a little bit of the ownership stake in the business. So, like currently in some of the propert, some of my key people, they have a little bit of equity, so they're on the journey with us. And our model has very much been, how do you like you come on the journey? We tend to hold a hotel for between five to seven or eight years and we look to probably exit and do something else. So I feel that I'm giving back, but equally I'm rewarding people that generally want to sort of see an asset grow, really get involved with the team. And so it's a win for both sides throughout. But I feel especially like kitchen, like, you know, of having a really good chef and having stability in is very key as well, that you're not changing. And constantly people. And that happens so much in our industry. And it would just be wonderful if we could be able to get people to stay a bit longer and really enjoy what they're doing.

**B** (12:23): Yeah, it just really helps to kind of maintain those standards. And if you've got like a philosophy or a term, very successful way of doing things, it just makes it so much easier for that to continue. And also if people there in house and event for a long time, eventually when they do leave you, they've had that time to kind of train up the next people below, haven't they?

**C** (12:43): Yeah, yeah. And. But people is everything in what we actually do. And you know, I, I, you know, being an owner of an of our own hotels, I always think, you know, when we're buying something, who is the team of people that is actually going to be able to deliver the performance of this hotel? Like, we can spend so much money on improving the asset, but we definitely need the people there that sort of buy into that as well and are very much part of that.

**B** (13:22): Yeah, definitely. And yeah. So to swing it round to, you know, those early days, as you mentioned earlier, what was it like for yourself and Crystal when you first started shaping the collection? Kind of what was behind the, the kind of guiding principles? Yeah.

**C** (13:42): I, well, we, it took us three years before we finally settled on Cotswold High. So I think we started looking in 1996. We looked at Lords of the Manor in the Cotswolds, came on board and I think we both had been to stay and we loved that property and thought this is really what we would love to be able to own and run. And I think we actually did bid and we got, I bid on that and then the opportunity did come up of Cotswold House and Chipping camden. Small hotel, 15 bedrooms. And we knew that there was an opportunity to add another farm, five rooms. There was a property at the back of it where we could actually live. And that was really where it started. And I think deep down we knew we wanted to have our own, make our own stamp. And this year was. It wasn't, I would say it had been run fairly well and then it had somebody who wasn't a hotelier who actually didn't do a great job. So it was, how do we actually turn this around? And I think I remember putting together like a business plan. We were used obviously on corporate days of writing business plans and actually writing it. This is what I would really, or what we would really like our hotel to look and feel like. So I, I knew at Heathrow I'd been involved more so than any of the other GMs in the design and creat of that property. But by when I saw we put exactly the same bit of art into every room and it was very formulaic, I thought, this is the time to do something different. And at that time there wasn't many people in the Cotswolds that actually we were pretty much at the very start of wanting to have a much more contemporary feel about the property. Carly Manor was been developed at that stage, but really it was ourselves and Kylie Manor that, you know, led. And now 20 years on, it's a very different business there. But it is the individuality of what we actually do, like from a design point of view. And I think we also see very much the team we've got. It's like. Like it's a family to us. And the community side, I think that was one of the things we really learned to really embrace in Chib in Camden and in. After about two years there, the community were really behind what we were doing. And yeah, I've just been able to start doing things and creating it for yourself. Great.

**B** (16:48): It must be really exciting. And I guess you take bits and pieces that you like and don't like, that you've kind of experienced over. Over your career.

**C** (16:56): Yeah.

**B** (16:57): Properties. I just wanted to ask how are the properties today in that sense and. And has it changed over the years that your approach or to the design or even the feel of the hotels and if there are any similarities between all the properties as well as obviously being quite unique to themselves? Yeah, it's wondering how it's developed over the years.

**C** (17:22): Yeah. Like, did we start out to develop and to have more than one property? Probably not. But like, certainly looking back on Cotswold Heights, where after three years we acquired the property across the road, the no Alarms Hotel. Then we also looked at buying a property, Northern Ireland being home Bush Mills. And I always saw there was a great opportunity to do something in Northern Ireland because there was no really lovely boutique hotels. But I now where we have four. I think you would walk into any one of the four hotels, probably not the latest one Jukes, because we haven't done a lot. We. We began to do a little bit there. But you would sort of sense and feel this is a kaleidoscope property. It's got your stamp on it. Like I'm the one that does the creation and the design. And pretty much like when you look at bedroom layout, like we have the same sort of guiding principles of how we actually go about that. And I think I always try and look and say, well, how do I like, you know, if I'm going to stay away, how does it. How is it going to feel different? How is it going to feel quite special and unique and what are those things that, that you're actually going to remember very much about your stay? And I think a lot of that starts with the bed, like a really great quality bed. And in our first property we actually had worked with hypnos and like we elevated it the bed higher than it normally was so that I actually had this lovely luxury feel and it had a really great under blanket and we recreated a pillow menu and give all those choices. So I, I think it. And we're also, we could combine a bit of traditional like where there was maybe a little bit of a nice antique pace or where there was something really unique. You know the baths. I know when we develop Montrose like we actually put in like we bought three baths and there were £10,000 each and like people say you're bonkers, why would you ever really want to do that? But it made such a statement about the bathroom and it just elevated the price. So I think it is always looking at how do you sort of respect where you are like, like what's the view out of the room like the landscape and how do you actually do your utmost best to make sure that it is as comfortable for who is going to stay.

**B** (20:20): I guess one of the questions that immediately comes to mind is especially for our listeners who maybe haven't had the opportunity to design their own property and make those decisions, what jumps out is how do you balance that risk of being kind of creative and again making a space that is so memorable and is welcoming to, to guests but also balance as you say, sometimes the kind of commerciality aspect of it and the design. I guess maybe sometimes they can be quite competing, composing kind of properties and ideas. How do you kind of juggle that and make sure that you know you make the right decisions in the end?

**C** (21:05): Yeah, that is challenging because like I, I think when you, you are creative it is quite challenging sometimes to stick rigidly to a budget. And you know if you, if I was doing something like in a corporate world it will be specified this is the amount that you would spend on like a bathroom, this is the what you would spend. Whereas I, we've always developed a little bit of where there's much more flexibility in it that you know some of the things if we can source well and actually buy it can allow us to spend on something which we believe is actually going to be much more stand out and it's going to create the wow factor and a lot, most of it we never really buy any new furniture. We work with a company called Petro Auction who tend to, they, they get work mainly in a lot of the five star hotels in London. So like most recently this foy has been selling off, Dorchester has been selling off and many of the others. And like we'll, I'll always try and buy some of the unique pieces in that there which will allow us to hopefully get like images which sort of do stand out and I refer to them as the hero images. Like last year we actually bought out of the Savoy. There was a big gazebo in the center of the gallery area and like I, I could visualize and see I want that there for our new spy area at Bishops Trow. So it's currently in store and it will be going next year and it will be a wonderful feature outside. So I, I suppose I'm skirting around answering the question is how do you really balance? I. I do think you have to be a bit of a risk taker. I think you do have to sort of, you know, you, you have to realize I may push the boundary a bit this way but hopefully I am going to get it back. And that has never really. I've never sort of looked. I'm really overspent or I've been. I've always felt that it has contributed to the overall effect and feel and then like other areas like if I think it can be delayed, we'll cut back. But generally we're not too bad and I think as being realistic about the budget and what you're actually going to do then if anything over the last four years since COVID the costs have just escalated tremendously on building costs and whatnot. And so you have to be really quite tight and appoint people and just be really trying to find the most cost effective way you can do. But you should never lose sight of your vision of what you actually want to achieve and do.

**A** (24:39): Running a hotel means juggling endless payments and expenses from suppliers to staff, all while keeping cash flow in check. That's where Apron helps. With Apron bill pay, you can manage all your supplier payments in one place, approve, schedule and sync automatically with Xero or QuickBooks. And with the Apron card, your team can spend easily while you stay in control. With spend limits, auto receipts, tracing and full visibility, every purchase earned rewards you can turn into cash back or gift cards. It's free to get started and built for small businesses.

**B** (25:10): Learn more@getapron.com it is potentially a way to do that is to you know, maybe stage the phases of a refurbishment or a redesign over a sustained period of time rather than going in and trying to do it all at once. I know it's kind of different approaches for, for maybe for different properties, but in your personal opinion how. How have you found that and would you advise?

**C** (25:38): I. I always think when you buy something you shouldn't do anything for six months you should or for a year you should just live with what you've actually got. I remember when, like, we bought Cotswold House, I was going to do all these rooms and straight away and whatnot. Never really thought. But actually you just need to live with what you've actually got. You've got to understand the asset and I think, and just be sensible, as you say, stage it where you probably do a bit that allows you to get the generation of new photographs of what you've actually got. We're currently going through the process with Jukes at the moment. Like, by tomorrow we'll have done three bedrooms out of the 18, and hopefully by April next year we'll have 10 complete. And I think as long as you. What I've always find is people love if. If they've bought into what you're doing, they love coming back and they love seeing the progress that you're making each time and they. They sort of become very attached to what's. What's going on. And like, since we've had Bishops Hotel, like, we've just been constantly doing that, evolving it. And like the spa project, we would love to have done that three years ago. Like, we've just got Ryan to doing it now and because we wanted to know we were doing the right thing before we actually embarked and doing that expenditure. So, yeah, be realistic. If you can get a bit going but don't feel you have to do, close the whole business. And we've never closed any business up with. Actually, we've always sort of continue to do the work and operate at the same time.

**B** (27:36): Yeah, it's something what you said just there actually, really, really stuck me about, you know, even involving guests on that journey, getting them invested in. Into the property if, you know, if they're loyal guests and they're coming back over the years and they're kind of growing as the hotel grows as well. I guess that must build quite a nice connection between the guests and the property itself.

**C** (27:57): Yeah. And one of the things that we have, like, we're just beginning to really think is like, the Kaleidoscope brand really has been much more internal. Like each business homeward stands and a zoom fee bird stands. But like, there I definitely. I think now we realize that with Kaleidoscope we can do much more together and, like, we can move people around from one property to another and. And that's certainly one of the plans for the year ahead is how do we galvanize and use that. But I am a great believer that every year you've got to be creating and doing something new with your property and you've got a reason to go out and talk to people. That's why you want to come back and see us and see what we've actually done. But it is innovation. You just can't sit still. You've got to be creating and coming up with wonderful new things. Like one of the things that we did, if anybody knows, the Abbey Hotel and Bath, year two, I think it was when we were there, we developed a ski bar just right outside the hotel, the Apres ski bar. It was a wooden shed and I thought, gosh, how are we ever going to get planning for this thing? And actually it went to a committee meeting and there was nine plan or nine in the committee actually voted yes, we would love to see it happening. And we did it and it ran for about six weeks. Sort of the Christmas mark started in Bath, but it was just phenomenal, the story and you know, a wooden chair decorated with a bit of glue, vine and whatnot. But it just helped to really be on the map.

**B** (29:59): Yeah, it's about, you know, it's a bit of thinking outside the box, being innovative and kind of finding those unique things. And especially when it comes to the beauty of having individual properties, they all have their own unique aspects that can be taken advantage of. As you say, like a simple shed, you know, with the right, with the right idea. Can, can yeah. Really make sense. Something.

**C** (30:22): Yeah, I'm like, you know, we covered it with snow or fake snow and it really looked apart and so, you know, that is really what sort of sets I, I think is, is being able to create and to, to deliver great experiences that guests actually engage in. And like we've done that very successfully at Homewood. Like this year we've just launched La Taverna, which is a new dining experience in a very bohemian looking tent. And we're going to use it and develop it as a bit of a ski, an apreski bar for this Christmas out there. So yeah, good ideas.

**B** (31:12): Brilliant. Yeah, I definitely think so. And yeah, I just wanted to ask, there's probably lots of listeners, listeners here at the moment would love to emulate the journey that you've been on and, and making that move from more kind of corporate structures to owning and operating their own hotels. I just wanted to ask what maybe surprising challenges or issues that you found making that, that leap and what advice would you give to somebody that would be looking to, to emulate what you've done and yeah, just tips and tricks maybe to make that journey a bit easier.

**C** (31:53): Yeah, the real challenge I think for most people is where do you get the money to get started and what sort of asset do you actually buy? And a lot of people probably the way to do it is to lease something. Like Chris and I were fortunate enough that the family helped us to get established and I think we're. There's nothing wrong with starting small. Like Cotswold House when we bought it was a million 1.25 million for a 15 bedroom hotel. And like eight years later it became an asset was worth 12. And so I think when you look and you can see those. But I think the biggest challenge is where you actually can get or partner with the right person who is actually going to. And I've seen it happen to quite a lot of colleagues who actually want to do their own thing. And sometimes you need to really know the fluidity of that partnership of the people that are backing you. So I would just be really careful on that side. But starting out small and, and actually where you create and you make it. And I think the one thing for Krista and I, when we did, when we started at Cotswold highs, we work seven days a week. We were, we ran it like Krista was the face of reception and covered quite a lot of the shifts. I did the restauran and like it just. And I suppose it is if you want to really put your mark on something you've got to do. And I think a lot of people actually want to do it, but I suppose is getting the finance and that's what I've tried to do with the people that have worked with us is where they can get like if they have a bit of equity in the business then like they, they make a reasonable size. Like, you know, I've had three that have gone through the assets that have benefit from like 500 to 800 to a million pounds. They've had the money to then put into something else. And I, I always think, you know, we're always looking for creatives that want to do and want to help in that side. And you know, currently we're looking at jukes. We would love where we've got a kitchen area there. Love that we would have a chef that, that would be interested and like where if we felt the person was right, we would give them the equity or set them up in a way that they can actually get in and do their own thing. But there's nothing more satisfaction satisfying than when it's your own.

**B** (35:02): So I just wanted to jump off that. I guess one of the option, the questions that I didn't immediately ask Was how, how did you know then was the right time to, to make that transition? And how. Yeah. Was it after being feeling prepared, after all the roles that you've done on your journey, or was it just more of the desire to, as you say, be in control, have, have your own stamp on things? What was it that jumped out of.

**C** (35:30): Leaving corporate to go into. Yeah, I think it, it was probably of realizing, you know, I've like, I've been a general manager, I've been probably the, and like the next stepped up was to be like an area manager and going around and, and I thought is that really me? I, I, you know, I like to be able to see and do something and see the, the effect of, of what I, the decisions I make would have on a business. And I think it, and I was always really interested in boutique properties. I remember one old witch came. We were one of the guests, first guests to stay in that and Gordon Campbell and I just was amazed at the artwork, the collections and whatnot. And I thought, thought this is really me. And I also did go and see Robin Hertz and because he had developed the first hotel divan dine in Winchester and we discussed the business plan and so it sort of felt once you start looking, this is the thing. And it was again of getting the structure set up right and making sure that we had enough equity against what we were going to borrow. But all that, you know, it can be sorted out. I think it's what, what is key is just getting something that is in a great location, something is going to work and we're. And also for us, like the model has always been, if we buy, it's been to buy something that underperforms where by investing in really great people, having great marketing, improving the asset, like hopefully the value of it's going to go up. Yeah.

**B** (37:36): They say what a decision that's been and yeah, isn't it? We've seen the Kaleidoscope grow and perform brilliantly over the years. That kind of leads us on to our final, final question before going on to the closing segment, which is, you know, what's next for Kaleidoscope? What's in the plans over the next year or so?

**C** (37:56): It's a tricky time at this moment in time in the business. I think it's been a tough year for most hoteliers. We have like, you know, we have a couple of assets that we could sell. We've tried to look at that over the last couple of years and it has really proved difficult because in interest rates have Been stubbornly high. Okay, we've seen a little bit of a drop, but just generally there's, there isn't the appetite. And I think it's one of the things I'm very keen that we can get back to where we can see a lot more excitement. And because the transaction level has been so low and I think it's made us really reassess that, you know, I think like listening to advisors and whatnot, that probably, if we want to, we probably got to hold on to what we've actually got. So I think instead of going out and buying something, like currently we're spending 2 million at Bishops Row where we want to redevelop the spa and create this as a great spa destination. So that's going to take up quite a lot of. And we've got planning permission where we could add another six bedrooms at Homewood, which are a great size. So we're looking at that. So I think over the next year, two years, we'll be holding on to what we've got, trying to grow those as best as we can. Because I think there is a real challenge now of buying assets is to like things have been able to get them at the right price, but I do think price will soften a bit more as well. So it's hold on, consolidate, build a brand of Kaleidoscope and then see if any in a couple of years time whether there's another one that will be ready to fit in.

**B** (40:04): Yeah, well, as I say, hospitality has always been one of those resilient industries. And yeah, it's been a bit of a tough time. Hopefully, you know, those kind of brighter skies are ahead and yeah, we'd love to see what's next once that's the. The case as well. And yeah. That brings us on to the final segment of the podcast, which sees a question left from the previous week's guest on this occasion. It was Josh Renouf, who is the circular design manager at Lamington Group. And he asked what is one waste material that your business uses that you wish you could could reuse and maybe what would you like to see it be reused as?

**C** (40:42): I think where we, a lot of what we actually do is like we repurpose things. I think I alluded to that very much of where we're not buying new and we're making good of older pieces of furniture, giving them a new lease of life. That's one thing. I think the other waste area that is sometimes is food wastage. What can we do with that? Those probably are the two areas that I think which we are focusing on, like we grow all our own veggies and like the building and construction side of it, we're not actually really doing. Like most of the assets we've got are listed, so it's actually we've got to work within those constraints there. But renewables certainly of more effective ways of heating is something that we're working on at homeward to. And part of the latest development is reducing that throughout the, the extension bit, which is quite a huge commitment to us.

**B** (42:12): Yeah, well, as you say, it seems like the businesses are already on the, on the, the right way of doing things. So I'm sure Josh would definitely approve of, of what you've got going on.

**C** (42:22): Thank you.

**B** (42:22): And yeah, Ian, that only really leaves us with one last thing to do, which is do you have a question for our next guest?

**C** (42:30): Yes. My question would be what do you think the impact of AI will look like in the hotel business and in three years time as to where will I take us? Like what will I. Will that be really very different to what we're doing currently at the moment?

**B** (42:56): How much is it going to accelerate over these three years bringing?

**C** (42:59): Brilliant.

**B** (43:00): Yeah, well we'll definitely put that to our to our next guest and see what they say. Ian, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us. We've really enjoyed it and I think our listeners will as well.
