### 2. Checking in with Karim Kassam, owner of Horwood House Hotel (0:32)

 Checking in with Kareem Kassam, owner of Horwood House Hotel. Karim talks about his career journey and the lessons he learned during his time in Dubai. How the right amount of realism and forward thinking are key when approaching an investment journey.


### 3. Social media is changing the way sales are done at hotels (4:16)

The websites and becoming more interactive and engaging rather than just an info site. Social media, by far the biggest change. We're now up at 14,000 Instagram followers. It's a very different type of marketing and sales to what you would have had 20 odd years ago.


### 4. Influencers can have a significant impact on customer or guest loyalty (7:37)

It's invaluable really, the, the reach of influencers these days, especially with younger guests. Have you seen that have an effect on customer or guest loyalty then? People want experiences. It's beneficial to be able to cater to those two different but equally valuable revenue streams.


### 5. You've been in hotels since university and recently acquired Horwood House Hotel (10:39)

Horwood House Hotel was acquired by a British hotel group. The hotel boss says he learned a lot about the industry in Dubai. He says he sees everyone as a member of the team. Can you tell us more about the site itself and what it offers?


### 6. Having that responsibility of it being your own venture solidified decision making (19:31)

I prefer to be like a realist. Some people will call it pessimistic, I call it being real. Once you commit to something, you can't change your mind. Do you think how approaching the situation with that realism, is that something that resonated with the lenders?


### 7. You just need to pitch yourselves. You don't want to be overselling yourselves (28:21)

There are still two or three things more that we can do internally in the space here and in the grounds. But I don't want to do them until I know we can deliver them properly. And I feel like it would be a DisService to be Ms. Selling Something.


### 8. Apart from difficulties with COVID were there other challenges along the way (30:03)

Covid was obviously the biggest one, but it had impact on absolutely everything. Just finding a basic team to deliver events was a really big thing. And then obviously with agency staff, because we're in such a remote space. We've now addressed it somewhat.


### 9. What do you look for for a successful Horwood House team member (37:17)

Hallwood House will take anyone if we feel that they understand our mission, vision, values. A lot of our team started with no hotel experience and are still here. You have to show team members that you're genuine. And beyond that, what's your approach to staff retention?


### 10. You have good connections with the local community at Horwood House (46:05)

Horwood House has good connections with the local community. Can you tell us more about what that looks like in practice? Everything we do is about being profitable and sustainable.


### 11. I wanted to ask you what trends you foresee shaping hospitality over the next few years (55:13)

How do you see the landscape looking over the next few years? I think experiences is something that's going to drive you to a hotel. Hoteliers need to be constantly doing something different to get people to keep coming back. You need to have relatable stories to tell to keep the interest from people.


### 12. Looking back at your career, what's one lesson that has stuck with you (60:02)

Don't be afraid to ask what you think is a really stupid question. What's next for Hallward House? Keen to find another property to get involved with.


### 13. In moments of uncertainty, what value do you rely on most to guide you (64:00)

Our last guest was Pierre Deberau, who's chief administration officer at Accor. He asked, in moments of uncertainty, what value do you rely on most to guide you? Karim: You have to have faith in what you're doing.


### 14. Do you think you can ever retire from hotel industry once you're in it (65:03)

Do you think you can ever retire from this industry once you're in it? It's a sentiment that we've seen come up with people. People so deeply fall in love with this industry. I imagine it's a hard one to leave.

**B** (0:32): Hi, I'm Heather, host of this episode where we speak to Kareem Kassam, owner of Horwood House Hotel. Karim spoke about his career journey, including the perspectives and lessons gained during his time in Dubai, how the right amount of realism and forward thinking are key when approaching an investment journey, the ambitious transformation of Horwood House and how collaboration, respect and transparency foster its strong team culture. Hi, Karim, welcome to Checking in and thank you so much for joining us.

**A** (1:03): No problem at all. It's a pleasure.

**B** (1:06): So, to begin, can you take us through your career history prior to acquiring Hallward House Hotels? And, yeah, tell us about some of the roles you held in your earlier career and the lessons learned from your time in those.

**A** (1:20): So hospitality has always really been something I've been keen to sort of understand, explore, be part of. My father had hotels sort of way back when, you know, from his initial sort of purchase back in the mid-70s, probably something he'd saved up a lot for, to sort of get into it. But he was very much more of a deal maker than a, you know, hospitality provider, if that makes sense. He was more about, you know, finding the next big deal. For me, there just happened to be a deal on the table that got over the line when I graduated out of university and there was a need for someone. My brother was operating hotels at that stage and there was a need for someone just to go in and manage the initial handover of the property. And I hadn't yet had any sort of offers that I'd like through for. What I wanted to go into initially was management consultancy, but I said, yeah, I can go and, you know, oversee the handover and just make sure everything's in place. And actually, to be honest, I ended up staying in hotels since then. And actually a very good way to get into it because you can sort of learn really from the bottom up in terms of getting involved with every department understanding it, and especially when there's no expectation to A degree because it was a new thing for. I didn't. I was going in and asking sort of questions as if I was a newcomer into the industry. My, my university education was management with computing but obviously textbook to. In practice is very, very different. So yeah, it was nice to have that start, I guess into, into sort of hotels and the operations of hotels and yeah, you, you learn a lot like that. You ask a lot of questions. We did a big refurbishment in the property a couple of years after. I was sort of engrossed into the property and then again that's a different level of learning. So I would say my early career was very much about just finding my way through different situations and scenarios. There wasn't anything specific I was going in to do and probably apart from the kitchen, probably the only department that I didn't get my hands dirty in. Otherwise you sort of learn everything from housekeeping to, you know, the house to accounts to reception to the reservation side sales calls. And back in the day, I'm talking sort of end of the 90s, it was a very different type of, you know, sales operation and to, to what it is today. So yeah, it was a nice way to I guess sort of get my hands dirty and learn the rope.

**B** (4:16): And you say that obviously the sales landscape was different at that time. In what ways was it different, would you say?

**A** (4:25): So I think there's a lot there about obviously online presence, about digital marketing, about social media. I think those are probably the three biggest changes and I guess that's something that's trended more recently in terms of social media. But probably the first thing was the websites and actually becoming more interactive and engaging rather than just an info site that I remember, you know, our first ever website being, you know, something more of a static or an electronic sort of brochure effectively. Yeah. And then a call the hotel if you want to make a reservation. So that's probably the first change that came about in sales. I think the teams now have grown as well. There's a lot more, although the same sort of big exhibitions and conferences out there, but there's a lot more of the, the, the, the smaller events and road trips that happen. I think that's another sort of big change. A lot more, a lot more of the socializing for sure and networking around, around events, but social media, by far the biggest change. And I think you look at our platform now and when I sort of purchased hall and house Hotel in 2019, the old operators didn't really do too much around it. It was part of A bigger hotel group. We had a few hundred, I think Instagram followers. We're now up at 14,000 Instagram. Instagram followers. It's not, you know, massive by any means compared to what other people have and what, you know, influencers themselves now have. But, you know, it's a very decent increase following the repositioning and everything we've been through here. And then you have these influences. So sales, you know, you don't need to go out necessarily for a particular market and we, we deal with, you know, leisure and spa and just sort of corporate business or, or weddings. Whatever people are coming here for has a different means to sort of attract them. But for the leisure market, the influences are great for people just looking to, to see what the next, you know, thing to do around Milton Keynes or Buckinghamshire or, you know, whatever they're looking for. You have influences that I've met last year or last month actually. We had our corporate summer party. I met an influencer that lives local. Really nice couple. Wouldn't have expected them to be influencers because in your mind you have, you know, young hit, trendy sort of people doing all sorts of crazy things. And this was just a normal couple, like I said, really great couple. They live local to us. I think it was one of our marketing team that made contact with them and they happen to come out and they've got like half a million followers and it's like, well, how do you do that? I mean, and people follow them and they'll do what they suggest or they'll, they'll, they'll find interesting. And all of a sudden that's another big stream of, you know, revenue coming into the hotel. It's, it's a very different type of marketing and sales to what you would have had 20 odd years ago, 25 years ago.

**B** (7:37): It's invaluable really, isn't it, the, the reach of influencers these days, especially with younger guests. And have you seen that have an effect on customer or guest loyalty then? I should say, particularly with the younger generation having that sort of avenue of direct engagement, I think it brings you.

**A** (7:56): A different revenue stream. So, you know, you would expect. And I've got three, my kids are old at 23, 21 and 17. So I can see how they interact with social media and what draws them to the latest restaurant or the latest sort of trend and you know, whatever it might be, street food or sports or whatever it is. And actually you, you expect to a degree less loyalty. And I say that not in a negative way because you Want. People want experiences. Now, they don't necessarily want to come back to Hoard House every week for if. If they can, you know, if they're fortunate enough to be able to come out for a leisure break every week or once a month, I think they would want to try different things. And we shouldn't be disappointed that they are not coming back to us every month, but we would want them to visit us every year, every six months, whatever it may be. So we. That's the way of the world at the minute. And, and I think you need to accept it, but you also need to understand it rather than just accept it. Because I'm. I'm the same if I go back to, you know, abroad to holiday. I went to Japan this year, but however amazing that was, I'm not going to be going back there next year and the year after, the year after. I want to see different places, I want to experience different things. And it's the same mentality that you should accept guests have. It's very different for the corporate traveler that's coming because they need to be in Central Milton Keynes for an event every, or a session or a seminar or whatever it may be every month. You would want them to keep coming back and feeling like, you know, we're a home away from home. And that's very much what we like to deliver. And that's what the team is getting more and more recognized for, which is nice because people leave us really good reviews, that the team is very friendly, really genuine, very hospitable. And for those people that need to be in the area, like I said, for that purpose, absolutely. We would want them to, to be more loyal. But the ones that we're attracting from the influencer side story, you would want them to come be blown away by their spa weekend or, you know, just their package to Bletchley park that we happen to be the accommodation and food provider for. But you would want to have them, you know, come back and say, actually, I've got my mother's birthday or I'm buying a gift for my brother or whoever it may be. And, you know, you'd want them to be thinking of you when they're doing those experiences or booking those experiences for others. And that's a difference in understanding loyalty, I think, and expectations from our side.

**B** (10:29): Yes, absolutely. And, you know, beneficial to have that flexibility, to be able to cater to those two different but equally valuable revenue streams. And so to talk about the beginning of your journey with Horwood House Hotel, can you tell us more about how that opportunity came about, what was behind the decision to acquire it. And then for our listeners who don't know, can you tell us more about the site itself and what it offers?

**A** (10:58): Yeah, absolutely. So I obviously have been in hotels, as I said, you know, really since the outset of coming out of university. So really since the outside of my working career, I spent a bit of time in Dubai when the management company that we were working, that I was working with for the Reading property, decided to grow into that region. So I started commuting out to, to Dubai early 2000s, and again, a very different work ethic, a very different culture, different way of doing everything, different laws, different mentality from the team because it very much is hierarchical there. So, you know, if you're a, a bellboy or a bell captain or, you know, a porter, people tend to, to call them that rather than part of the team. Something that I've done very much through the early parts of my career is I really do see everyone as a member of the team. Everyone's really at the same level. Obviously, on paper there is a hierarchy. So I would expect the general manager to do something different to a restaurant manager, to do something different to a receptionist, for example, or a room attendant. But actually everyone calls me by my first name. Everyone. I will try and call everyone by their first name unless they're a new member of staff, I don't know. But I think I learned a lot of how to treat people from my early days in Dubai and how I would expect to be treated. Although over there, like I said, it's very, very hierarchical. So I learned a lot in Dubai on the people side and the engagement side with the team. We did a lot of work with developers out there because at the time we were contracted to operate the hotels and service departments that they were building for us to take on completion. So I got involved in development out there with the locals that were dealing with these big international architecture firms and project management firms. And that's again, it opens your eyes into a whole different sort of side of the hotels, like pre taking over and fitting out and furnishing and everything else and then staffing up and then setting up all of the legal side in terms of the companies and all of those sorts of requirements. So I learned a lot out there. Dubai at the time also the only place in the UAE actually not just Dubai, was where you could, where you could purchase alcohol was in a hotel. They were the only licensed premises, so you wouldn't have them like you do now in lots of Other sort of apartment buildings in freehold areas or like the big shopping malls now are associated somehow to, you know, be able to get a license. So you would then increase your food and beverage offering and the premises that you would develop that were being developed by it for you, by the developers because you would want more and more people coming in. So your revenues were pretty much 50 food and beverage and 50% rooms, you know, as a guide. Whereas over here when I was involved early in the career, it was about 90, 95%, you know, rooms and a little bit, maybe, maybe slightly, slightly less if you had conference facilities, but otherwise it was only 5% food and beverage. 10 food and beverage. So a very different operation there. You also had to think out the box about what types of restaurants you were offering. We were very much initially in Dubai for four star hotels. So again you're pitching it your standard. We would do like a British pub, we would do a Chinese restaurant, an Indian restaurant and maybe like an all day dining space. And those were typically, you know, four of your main eating spaces and then a couple of other bars, like maybe one around the pool and one somewhere else. But again, they were the, because they were the only places you could, you could serve alcohol, you would rely on that revenue coming in and you would then build up a local clientele to wherever your hotel was. So learning that side of how to attract people, what they wanted, it just opened my eyes a lot being in Dubai. So I, I do think a lot of the ideas that I generated and because I had the freedom to do it, because I was the one setting up the Dubai operations, I think I learned probably the most to get me going and excited about, you know, opportunities whilst I was in that sort of eight year Dubai phase. So we probably did six hotels at the time and like I said, really involved from developing to fitting out to then putting a team together and all of that. We work with a couple of brands because we signed to five star hotels whilst we were out there as well. Again, the way the Dubai market works, things change a lot. The developments got sold so we never went on to open them. But actually if I look at the floor prints of two of the biggest hotels on Shape Z Road, one just off, one on right now, I've effectively put the floor plans together for them with the architects that we're working on. So that's nice to see that actually there's still something, something there that I've left a bit of a mark on, I guess. Yeah, but you learn, you get, you get given a Lot of respect, I think there because you're acting for a local owner, for example. But again, I do think respect is there to be earned rather than just given to you or you don't, you know, it's not a, it's not a given that everyone will, I guess, show you that respect. I do think it needs to be earned. And again, that's another big learning for me. But also that's my character. So I don't go there and say, I'm the owner, I'm the boss, you need to do this, that and the other. Or can you ask so and so to do this? I'll just go and ask them myself or I'll do it myself or, you know, I'm very much hands on like that. So again, it's just, it's interesting to see how that was received in Dubai and that how that's received here, because it's very different. Yeah, yeah, A lot of learnings from there. And then I came Back to the UK 2012 ish. Got back involved with the business that was here. But actually because I'd done so much on my own in Dubai, I came back not really having a fixed role, if that makes sense. I was doing, I was doing a lot but you know, I wanted to do, I wanted to do something for myself. So I looked for my own opportunity. I finally came out of the business maybe 20, 17, 18 and started looking for something. And it took a lot of hotels because again, I was. Previously I'd been working, I guess, with other people's money, you know, and it's easier to not have to, you know, you can still sleep at night if you make a mistake. Not that I ever, you know, when did anything that I was happy to lose money on. But yeah, you weren't losing money out of your back pocket. Now all of a sudden I was, I had a pot of money that I'd taken out of the businesses that I've been invested in to put it into my own venture. And you become a lot more nervous. So I think it took a year and a half to find something that I really liked. And hou I think was just that, literally from turning into the driveway, the long drive down to the manor house that you see straight ahead. And I think it was a miserable day that I saw it as well. And actually you, you could just see the potential straight away. Yes, there were things that, you know, were what they were because that was the way the building had been developed and expanded or extended rather sort of over time. But, but actually you could see that there was so much more the property could do. So I did really sort of fall for it, you know, straight away. And then within three months we'd agreed terms and we went on to complete in September of 2019. So that's how it came about. It seems a long time ago. It was actually six years ago, just. Yeah, last month. So, yeah, I don't know where the time's gone.

**B** (19:28): I'm sure it's been a very busy six years. And do you think approaching this, having that responsibility of it being your own venture, having that sort of, I don't know if burden's the right word, but coming into it with that perspective, did that then solidify for you the decision making choice in terms of having so much invested in making sure the first site was, was the right fit for you?

**A** (19:56): Yeah, I think it did because it was such a. I don't, I, I've always been used to working in large ish properties. So, you know, I, I'd seen a lot that, that was 30 rooms or 50 rooms and I just couldn't see how I could turn it to make it a lot better. That would give me a better platform to grow from. So, you know, this had 185 rooms, which was a lot I fully appreciate. But it's the fact that I could see so much outside with it that made me take, you know, the bold, brave step, whatever you want to call it, to actually commit to it. And I've got friends of mine even now that sort of joke about the fact that I, I'm a little bit indecisive. I'm, you know, I, I take time to make a decision, I sit on the fence a lot, you know, whatever the terminology is. But actually once you're committed, you're done. You have to, you know, and I'm very much that way. So yes, it might take me a while to make a decision, but once I'm there, I will fully commit to it. And I guess you have to because over here when you're investing all your own money, I had a plan as to what I'd need to spend. I'd pitched it to the lenders already. They brought into all of my, you know, projections. They could see they were very realistic. And again, I'm not a super, super optimistic person. So I will always be, you know, realistic on my projections and I think that's good for me. I think a lot of people a bit more bullish and I just prefer to, to, to be like a realist. Some people will Call it pessimistic, I call it being real. And then, and then sort of, you know, go, go from there. But once, once you commit, you have to sort of, you have to sort of. I think you have to just, just go with it. You can't change your mind. You can't be indecisive once you're in it already.

**B** (21:51): Yeah.

**A** (21:51): And, and like you said it, because it's your own, you feel the burden and it is a burden. I'm not going to, you know, butter up any other way. It very much is a burden until you see the returns coming back from what you're expecting.

**B** (22:05): And do you think how approaching the situation with that realism, is that something that resonated with the lenders? Do you think it's beneficial in terms of showing authenticity and transparency?

**A** (22:22): I think it definitely works that way. You, you also sometimes have a need to be bullish because you want them to, you know, you want the lenders to maybe be a bit more generous up front so that you can do more in order to achieve what you know, will, Will be able, you know, where you'll be able to get to.

**B** (22:46): Yeah.

**A** (22:46): So does work both ways. But I'm very, very much. I, I like, I, I don't like to stretch the truth. I think I will be real in my, in, in my, my view and my sort of expectations and my vision. I think you need to, you need to have some faith in that. But I still, you know, I might say we could get to here, but actually this is what I'm putting on paper because this is what you're going to judge me on when it comes to the, the loan that you might make of me or what you're going to expect me to be or where you're going to expect me to be in two years or three years or whatever. So, you know, on, on, on this particular project, I surpassed even my wildest expectations and projections where I am today and what I'd said six years ago to the, to the lender as to where I'd be. So I can see that journey. And that's not just because I was super pessimistic. I think things changed a lot. Obviously, I bought the hotel and then we were pretty much straight into Covid. So, yeah, that was a whole other story. So when you talk about, you know, was it a burden? Absolutely. I've been through, I've been through a lot, just. And everyone did go through Covid, but I just taken all of my money out of everything else, put it all into this property and all of a sudden Covid comes along. So even the bangers know that whatever they judge you on goes out the window at that stage. And they had to support hotels that were going through whatever they were going through because otherwise they would be recalling loans from, you know, from everyone in the country. Yeah, it wasn't something that was obviously feasible. So that, that did change my perspectives on what I was going to do, some of the plans. And I think when I look back to it now, I was literally. The hotel was closed, obviously. I think it was the 22nd of March, remember, 22nd, 23rd of March, whatever it was, 2020. I was sat in the. In the manor house. I had one of the. The old meeting rooms as an office in the. In at the beginning. And I was sat there looking down the driveway because it's, like I said, a beautiful drive, a beautiful view out there, no one else in the hotel. And I've said, I've just bought, you know, this property. I don't have any money left to do anything and what have I done? And I still needed to develop it because it was bought. When I bought it, it was very much unloved, you know, hadn't really had any works done. A few of the rooms had been redecorated, but it really did need a complete, you know, refurbishment, repositioning. And so I sat there and, you know, thought about what I could do, you know, what was happening. And as everyone's aware, during COVID there was a whole thing around, you know, well, wellness and well being that sort of picked up. There was a whole thing about working from home that started. So, you know, the plans evolved from what I was going to initially budget at four and a half million to, you know, more like the six and a half that I ended up spending to make some of the rooms larger. So we knocked some of the rooms two into one, which is why we're now at 159 rooms and not at 185 rooms. We have a full service spa. Initially it was only going to be a couple of treatment rooms in, like, a nice area, but, you know, more just so that we had another facility to offer. Now we've got six, seven. We're ready for seven treatment rooms, but we're operating six treatment rooms, a really nice large sort of gym that has local membership as well. And we completely refurbished the swimming pool area, added some seating around the sides, developed out into the courtyard and created a bit of a Zen courtyard that was really before just an unused space that you could see from the swimming pool. We have a nice studio now. So really the offering is completely different. And if anything, out of the six and a half million that I've spent, probably the one and a half ish that I spent down there has been the biggest change in terms of what's now coming into the hotel. Because the spa is generating, you know, a very decent turnover. We always continuously look at, you know, the efficiencies and profitability. But again, although profit is very important, sometimes you need to have these facilities to also attract people into the property. Even if they're making less money than say your rooms department or, you know, your FB department or whatever it may be. It just creates for us a better offering all around. And it goes with our repositioning because we, we can call ourselves a destination for everyone. So you literally do have people just coming for spa breaks. You, you do have people coming for their weddings and for family, special, you know, special family occasions. We do lots of 50 50th, 60th, 80th birthday parties. We do lots of banquets for corporates and other organizations. We, you know, our primary business during the week is residential conferences. So that's a really big part for us because that's, that's the basis on which the hotel, I guess, business is built. That's what it started out as, as an event space. But we're now doing elevated offerings. We're doing, you know, a much better food and beverage offering when it's profitable. It's not just volume based, it's actually, you know, giving us a good, good return from which to sort of build and grow the offering more. But you sort of need all of these things to come into it and you need to do them well. You just need to pitch yourselves. You don't want to be overselling yourselves. And I think, yeah, again, that's another big learning for me, that there are still two or three things more that we can do internally in the space here and in the grounds. But, but I don't want to do them until I know we can deliver them properly. I don't want to, you know, sell something and then people are not happy with it because it's, it's mine. And I feel like it would be a DisService to be Ms. Selling Something or overselling something to someone. I know it happens out there all the time in the market, not just here, it's all over the place. But I'm, I like to be like, just like with the lenders, I like to be very realistic about what we're doing and what we can actually achieve and deliver. So, again, I think I still get told all the time by some of the team members even that, you know, come on, this is like, let's just try something. And I said, well, when you can guarantee we can do it properly, then we will do it. I have a list of three or four things I'd like to do, but I want to do them properly. Yeah, yeah. And I think that's another big learning for me. But that's just me, you know. Yes, it might bring in massive revenue streams and it might give us a bit more profit, but if it's not going to be there next year because we don't do it properly, then what was the point in the first place?

**B** (29:40): Yeah, yeah, sounds like a great approach to building that foundation and, yeah, the importance of forward thinking and really thinking about the wider vision for the site. Yeah, that's valuable advice.

**A** (29:54): You'll see from how the conversation goes with me that once I start talking about the hotel, I can go off in all different tangents as well.

**B** (30:02): Brilliant, brilliant. So just looking back at that, that process of breathing life and love back into the hotel through these investments. Aside from the obvious difficulties of the timing with COVID were there any other challenges along the way? And if so, how did you navigate those?

**A** (30:23): Covid was obviously the biggest one, but it, it had impact on absolutely everything because. And I guess other hotels that were going through Covid obviously went through the same closures that we did. That, that's, you know, a given. But actually, then when we opened up post Covid, and there were obviously a couple of sort of reopenings and closings, if you recall, with COVID we were working with the team that didn't necessarily want to be here because the owners had changed. It was a big change in the first place for them. Some of them had been here a very long time. So, you know, as soon as furlough was done, they were gone as well. We were working with agencies, chefs, for example, in the kitchen delivering weddings that had been sold three years potentially prior to when they were actually being delivered because of the delays with COVID So the ex for what was sold to them, even though it was a completely different product, really, what was sold to them was very different to where they ended up getting married. So, yes, I, I for sure it was a better offering, but it's not what they had booked. So you would then get, you know, problems coming up with delivering events that people had booked a room with a red carpet and now it's, you know, a gray, nice beige, gold color, and they would comment on that. So all of a sudden you're having to deal with those sorts of issues from people that. And fair play to them. They booked what they booked, you know, and that's what they wanted to go with. So you'd end up having to deal with a lot of those sorts of queries, which is just not needed when you've got so many other problems going on, like just finding a basic team to deliver events. So agency staff was a really big thing. And then obviously with agency staff, because we're in such a remote space, although we're only 15 or 17 minutes from the center of Milton Keynes, and we now have the East West Railway sort of big station in Winslow, which is a mile and a half away. All great for us. There's no public transport at the front door, so anyone getting to us needs to either drive here or be driven here or walk, which isn't so great because you've only got a couple of villages around us that, you know, they wouldn't typically be staying at. We have a lot of the kids from the local villages that work on in casual hours with us, and they're all great and they get dropped off by their parents or they drive when they learn to drive. But actually your main bulk of the team will come from the wider area. So with agency staff, you're having to give them a hotel bedroom to. So that takes it out of your potential revenue stream and you could have 12, 14, 16 agency rooms at any one stage when you're busy through that period. We've now addressed it somewhat because the last bit, the extra half a million that took the six to six and a half million, went into refurbishing and sort of putting back into use our gate house at the top of the driveway. So we now have sort of team members staying there, which was great for us. We still have time in the hotel, but I guess we. We've learned to sort of manage with the inventory that we have. And, you know, that works for the number of team members we have currently in the hotel. But the team is probably the biggest issue that we've had to put together to find people, because again, remember, out of COVID if you were comfortable where you were, why would you take a leap of faith and go and move somewhere that's just been repositioned, just been bought, just putting a whole new team together. And I think at the time people wanted the security of work as well, because obviously once furlough was done. They were back to. Back to normal in that respect. And obviously, as we all know, Brexit really came in and started impacting us at that stage because you couldn't get. A lot of people went back to, you know, they. Their European sort of home countries. It was just a lot around the team. So you were paying more for team members to not really want to be here, like by choice, if that made sense. Just because it had, I guess it was nice and new on one side. I really did luck out with finding my general manager in April 2021. So just at the time that the first block of bedrooms were coming back from the refurbishment that started the beginning of 2021, and our Harry's bar and kitchen and I think our reception, no reception was a bit later, but we had bits of it coming back at that stage. So she was really there just at the right time to sort of help me think around the operation more. And she's still with me. She's amazing. We, you know, we, we very much are on the same page in terms of our, our approach to, to management, to what, you know, to get, what to expect from people, what to. How to incentivize people to, you know, really commit and learn and put everything back into the, the property. And that's one of the reasons, like I said, we get really, really good reviews from, from guests and we get that constantly fed back to us from the big corporate events that we do. And yeah, like I said, I think it's amazing that we've been able to build our loyalty to the corporates and to the leisure market just from that. So you have lots of negatives and you have lots of mistakes that people will make, but it's very much about how you deal with those complaints and queries and how you appease the guests and make them understand why a mistake happened and learned from it. It's like anything else. You just have to learn from it and show that you're genuinely, you know, genuinely bothered about everything. Yeah, and not just show it, feel it, because it's, it should be genuine. It's not just. It's not just an act or it's not just a facade you put on. I think everyone very much, everyone here very much feels like they're part of a hub of, you know, a community, a family. And like I said, I can walk through the hotel and call everyone by name. I'm approachable. That all helps. And I think that's just in the demeanor that you sort of put out as you, as you Sort of go, go through your property and go through, through the motions of any particular day.

**B** (36:59): Yes. And, and I think when you have a. Such a strong team like that, guests can pick up on whether it's authentic or not, can't they? And I imagine that that resonates very well when it's so deeply felt by, by everyone who's part of the team there.

**A** (37:15): Yeah, absolutely.

**B** (37:17): And, and just on the note of, like you say, creating this team that you have around you, what was your approach to that? What, what values do you look for for a successful Horwood House team member? And beyond that, what's your approach to staff retention? I, I know we've touched a bit on, on the training provided and whatnot, but. Yeah. Can you tell us a bit about your, your approach to, to team building in that way?

**A** (37:50): We're very much about, obviously you've got the different levels or the different sort of. Yeah, levels. Positions that you're recruiting for. So, you know, if you start at craft level, I think you're talking, you know, food and beverage assistants, receptionists, room attendants, I guess that sort of entry level team. We will literally take anyone if we feel that they understand our mission, vision, values, I guess, you know, and we're very much, we're very much about, you know, encouraging people to learn on the job, ask questions, be curious. It's one of our sort of, you know, internal mottos to be curious. Because unless you understand what you're doing it, what you're doing and why you're doing it, you can't, you can't do it, genuinely, you can't do it sincerely. And I think that's a big thing for us. So, you know, a lot of our team started with no hotel experience and, and are still here and in fact, you know, progressing very well. So our reception manager joined probably just after I purchased the hotel. So she was probably the first hire as a receptionist in probably November of 2019 or October, November 2019. And actually she's now our reception manager. She's amazing. She came from, I think she was cabin crew. So, you know, again, that was a whole upheaval in that industry when Covid happened. So yeah, she just wanted to do something where she was engaging with people. So she had no hotel experience. Very hospitable, great customer service and that's why she's developed into the role that she's got today. So I think there's an element of understanding the person for sure at whatever level, At the more senior levels, you're definitely looking for people with experience, you, you definitely, they, they need to buy into your mission, vision, values. And actually 2021, again, when Caroline, my general manager, joined me, we had a few other senior positions that had come in and we had to pay really big, not really big, but the same as everyone else. We had to pay a lot of recruitment, sort of consultancy sort of fees to find all of these positions for us because again, it was a new property and we were trying to sell the opportunity to these guys, at least give us an opportunity to buy into us. I think at that stage when we had that first senior team on board, we started discussing what my vision for Hallwood House was, what I thought it could become. And then together we sat down and discussed what we wanted as our values for the, for the hotel and for the team and what we wanted to build our whole sort of operation around. So, you know, we had very much had various team members involved in that process. So that was, that was, that was good for them. It's good to tell that to, you know, the, you know, recently arrived team members as well, because they feel like it's a very inclusive sort of space and a place to work, I guess. So it definitely helps. You have to, you have to show team members that you're genuine. And again, I don't mean show them, I mean actually be genuine so they can buy into, you know, the long longevity of the, of the opportunity for them. Because in this current climate with hospitality opportunities, you know, I guess less appealing to a lot, a lot of the sort of, you know, working, sort of the working population, you want to stand out and you need people to buy into what you really, what you really offer. So I think that's a big part of it. Development and training we've touched on. Obviously there's a lot of people that we ended up recruiting at a cost from recruitment consultants that then were able to bring in colleagues because they liked what we did here. And even if they didn't work out themselves, the fact that they then introduced us to someone in my mind as a way of writing off the cost because it was very costly at one point, you know, with all the fees we were paying to either temporary agent, temporary staff coming in or the recruitment agents to find us senior teams that sort of build around. So genuinely, if we look today at our senior team and I would look at sort of hotel manager, general manager, sort of director, sales exec, chef, senior team, they've all been with us now for probably four years, the hotel manager is a new role that we introduced to, to help with the operation. He's now coming up to a couple of years, but the senior team really all have been with us for four years. I've had one person leave last year, and that was due to sort of just, I think, coming to the end of a career with us and where he could take us to. So we were looking to progress that role. But apart from that one person, the senior team's all been here for four years, which is great, you know, in today's market, I think. And it's because we genuinely look after the team. We give them a voice. They're able to. They're able to really say anything they want, even if they don't agree with something that, you know, we say as. As an idea or as a next step. And we pay. We pay well. We pay well. We pay retention bonuses. So if people are still with us after a chunk of time, they get. They get a bonus. But that's. That's part of their package as far as I'm concerned. And it works both ways that we're then getting them to commit to us, and it shows our commitment to them by giving them a little bit extra at the end of, you know, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, whatever it is. So there's a whole different array of things, but I genuinely think people are here with us because they want to be with us. Yeah, I am sure they could go to other places. Like I said, it's difficult to recruit into hospitality roles now, and I think there would be other opportunities for them at other places. But I genuinely feel we treat our people very fair. They see me as an owner. I was talking to someone this morning and they, you know, you come in as a manager maybe, expecting things to be a particular way, and then they'll see me in a function room helping to put a dance floor down or, you know, clearing a bar down or moving linen in a. In a bedroom corridor because they're, you know, whatever. For whatever reason. And that's not me doing something for the sake of it. It's just me doing it because I'm happy to help wherever I need to, especially if I'm just walking through the hotels at whatever stage. So I think they see that, and I think that sort of also helps people get on the same level. Like I said, we're all one team. Pay for hierarchy. Yes. But actually we're all the same at the end of the day, and I think that helps with everything in terms of retention and development. We do team development days and we're getting that extended out to know not just managers, but the next level down as well, so that we're all spending more time together, they're understanding what we're talking about. We're trying to get everyone to be a little bit more interested in the actual numbers, even though they don't need to be necessarily all the way through. But it all helps identify why we do, why we make certain decisions and why we do things in a particular way. So, and we, we, we again, we, we ask people to join the dots. That was the theme of our big development day earlier this year and I think we'll have another one in January or February next year. But, you know, joining the dots, being curious, like I've said already, it just, you know, we, we don't want people to feel that any question is a stupid question.

**B** (46:03): Yeah, yeah. Now I was going to say what, what really stands out to me from what you've just said is, is the kind of innate collaborative nature of Horwood House, which, yes, I suppose goes back to, as we said, about respect and giving everyone that, that opportunity to use their voice and be part of the journey.

**A** (46:24): Yeah, absolutely.

**B** (46:25): And as well as the community of Horwood House itself with your team, I know obviously you have good connections with the local community. Can you tell us more about what that looks like in practice and the importance from your perspective of having these local partnerships and in that relationship with your location?

**A** (46:48): So I think for us and for me, although the, the journey and the investment and I guess everything we do is about being profitable and sustainable for, for me, for the lenders and, and everything else, I think because of the type of property we are, you know, were selling 40 acres of land and I can't remember in which sort of press release someone referred to us as custodians of the, you know, some of the British countryside. And I think I really, I really sort of resonate with that because I think we want people to visit us just for the grounds. We want people to come and experience what we offer in our Harry's bar and kitchen because, you know, we've elevated the food and beverage offering to a really, really, you know, good level. The exact chef's been amazing, I think, and he's, he's local as well. He, he was, he did his, his sort of catering, sort of education in Bletchley College. So literally, you know, 10 minutes down the road and now he's found his way all the way back to us here as exact chef. He joined us as head chef and, you know, he's now exact chef. And that goes again back to our. Him buying into what we're offering compared to what the place was before and the opportunity and you know, the desire to grow with us as well. But the wider community again, right from the COVID days, we had all the local neighbors from the villages walking. When everyone got into walking, obviously as a, as a part time, they would walk through the grounds, obviously the private estate. But you know, we weren't bothered about letting people walk through and explore the grounds. I met a lot of people, they were, you know, talking about the plans, what we were going to do and I really did, you know, want it to be a bit of a hub in the community. I mean the hotel's called Forward House. We've got a village next to us as you drive out to the left. That's Little Hallward. We've got the Marsley Village every. They're all really nice communities and I wanted this to be a little bit of a hub for, for everyone. So yes, we put out a lot there to local marketing. We, we host events like we've done, I think a jazz evening outside on the Paris and Harry's that, you know, we invite the locals to. So it's just an offering. It's. We don't make money from it. They. But they, they can come and enjoy and see what this is about. We've just done something recently which was musicals in the manor which again we work with MK Music Academy, someone we've met locally through a networking event because, you know, you meet all of these local connections that way and we have someone that does all of our outreach for us and she's our creative consultant and you know, puts all these ideas together and we'll go and deliver them. And again, although they cost money, it's just a nice way to bring people into the hotel. So another thing that she's done, we had an arts and crafts fair for the first time that we did did earlier this year, I think it was in March if I'm not mistaken. And she went out and found 50 exhibitors. So again, no fee for them to exhibit. They just exhibited all over the hotel. It was a weekend, I think it was a Sunday and it was a free ticketed event for people to come in and just, just see again the hotels. But more so the, the different exhibitors and we had people showcasing art pieces that they'd done. We had art societies come in and you know, take spaces around the hotel, local craftspeople that make soaps and all sorts of stuff. And again it was. We didn't make money. We probably. I'm not saying we lost money, but there was a cost to it for us. For me, it's. It's more about just engaging with the community. So you've got the ability to do that because we've got the space to do that and we have someone on our side willing to go out and set it all up. But then we also do things like support the local schools on whether it's raffle prizes for their summer or Christmas fates or whatever it may be. We had a local group of three schools that just had a summer fun run and we, you know, provided just. We don't do a lot of cash contributions, but we, we did sponsor them on this occasion to help help underwrite some of the costs that they had. We support and sponsor Merza United Football Club, just which is just down the road. A couple of the teams and their sort of, you know, set up. And again, it's all stuff. It doesn't come back to us financially, I don't think. But it's, it's outreach. It's nice to do one of the biggest charitable contributions. I know we're talking community, which sometimes mean. Means more local. But we work with Crisis, you know, the, the sort of homeless charity.

**B** (52:06): Yeah.

**A** (52:06): And we have created a space downstairs that we worked with a company called Recoup. They. They created, we call it our Crisis Coffee Lounge. So they have upcycled furniture with Crisis members and then decorated the space. It's on our website. There's some amazing pictures and we. Yeah, again, it was an area that I needed to redecorate anyway. So rather than paying the interior, the interior designers to do something and, you know, the contractors that were working on site to do something, we left that space knowing we were going to work with Recoup on this particular space. It was a company that Caroline, the gm, had worked with previously. And it's worked out really well because it's a great story. It's allowed us to work with Crisis. So it's benefiting them that way. We sell Crisis. They work with the local sort of coffee bean supplier to create Crisis coffee beans. So we use Crisis coffee beans in that particular space and now actually in our spa lounge as well. And there's a contribution that goes back from each purchase of a bag of coffee from them back to Crisis. So there's an extended story there. We do something in our housekeeping where if you don't get your room serviced, if you're staying with us for more than Two days and you choose to sort of, you know, bypass a service. We'll contribute a hot meal back to Crisis or the equivalent of a hot meal back to Crisis in monetary terms. So we've probably donated something like 23, 20, 23,000 pounds so far to Crisis since we started that initiative. And it's just again, it's a feel good story. It offers the team here with us to understand that it's not all about money for someone that, you know, could take the money away as profit. Actually we do need to do this outreach. I think the world only becomes a better place by people doing, doing more. And yeah, that's one of the national charities we work with Will and Hospice as well, another local charity. We work with medical detection Dogs, another local charity. And we had all of these guys here at our corporate summer party so that all the guests attending and we had, you know, 150 odd guests here that night just to showcase what we do, how he helps people. But it's, I guess if you're a corporate using us for a residential conference, it's giving them access to the same sort of, you know, I guess, yeah, that social sort of impact piece from their side that they would need to do anyway. But it's, it's just nice to do it. It does make you feel good. I know people call it, you know, feel good for a reason, but it does make you feel like, you know, you're, you're, you're. If you're in, if you are fortunate enough, I guess that's the word to be able to do it, why wouldn't you do it? And again, people see that, so it's a nice thing but we're happy to help.

**B** (55:13): Coming to a close, looking at the industry as a whole, I wanted to ask you what sort of trends you foresee shaping hospitality over the next few years and how hoteliers can prepare for this and adjust to it. I know we've obviously talked about the development of social media and engagement in that sense. Sense. But yeah, how do you see the landscape looking over the next few years?

**A** (55:40): I think there's definitely a trend already that, you know, for people not necessarily going abroad for every possible, you know, time they have off and I think that used to be, that used to be sort of a given that if you had a weekend or if you had a few days with how cheap flights were and still are, I guess at some point, you know, that was always an option. I think people like to explore the country now. I think experiences is something that's Going to drive you to a hotel and a destination, especially a place like this that's out sort of in the countryside, central London or, you know, the other big cities. And there's a lot now coming up. I think you go there for. For what's around the hotels, not necessarily for the hotel, if that makes sense. Whereas here, and there are a lot of hotels like us now that really need to. Need to sort of just be constantly doing something different to get people to keep coming back. I think the influences, like you said, you know, have. Have an impact on bringing people in, but it's difficult. So, obviously the spa and leisure guests, we keep changing and introducing new things there. We've introduced some new treatments and bought some new machines and that's something that helps. You know, I think they're calling it biohacking. So, you know, it's. It's the whole aesthetics, it's feeling good, it's doing something that's good for you, but that's a. That's just one target market and I think that's an easy one to maybe, you know, keep up to date with trends on general hotels. Really difficult. I do think people need to buy into your teams, your service, your various food and beverage offerings. It helps that we now have various awards under our belt because that was a nice, you know, milestone to. To reach that we've got. Yeah, we've got Company Company of the Year under the Buckinghamshire Business Awards last year, alongside Hospitality Business of the Year. And I won an award for Business Leader of the Year for the Buckinghamshire community. We do similar with the Milton Keynes Business Business Achievement Awards and I think those all help to sort of add to your story and add to your appeal and it's something else you can shout about and bring people in. I think you do need to have stories to tell to keep, you know, the interest from people. Our Executive Chef has just been nominated as Chef of the Year for an industry award as well. We've had our Head of Pastry and his sort of junior Pastry chef win awards earlier this year at hrc. And all of those stories that you can tell bring people back in. Weddings have won an award this year as well. So they're all accolades and, yes, it's nice to have them, but it's also something that I think you need to shout about to keep people interested and to show that you're evolving and developing. And I know you're asking about trends, but I do think you need to have relatable stories to tell about the team that you have in order to, to keep that as a means of a way to sort of attract people to you. General hospitality trends. I really just do think that you need to be switching up the offer regularly in a destination like this. Like I said, some areas you will only go because you need to be in the area, not necessarily in the hotel. Here you have to switch up what the hotel is offering, whether it's a pop up restaurant or whatever it might, might be. And you know, that's things that I've mentioned earlier that I want to put into place but when we're ready to do them, I think it's a difficult, it's a very difficult general question to get anything more.

**B** (59:55): No, no, but that's a great, that's a great answer and yeah, food for thought. I, I think for our listeners. So looking back at your career, what's one lesson that you would say has stuck with you or, or similarly, what's one piece of advice that, that if you could, you'd, you'd leave our listeners with? I know there's obviously been a lot of great nuggets of advice in our conversation, but if you could pick out one thing, what would it be?

**A** (60:23): I definitely think that you cannot be afraid to ask what you think is a really stupid question. And. I don't think people understand how, how much people appreciate that you've asked a stupid question because it means you're genuinely interested in the answer, if that makes sense. Yeah. And it's not just me as an owner saying that I wish I had been that way at school because now it's something I've learned later in life because I remember being in school and not putting my hand up. You know when the teacher says he knows the answer to this question. And I said, well, I know, but I'm not going to put my hand up because you know, I'm case I'm wrong. Don't worry about being wrong. Just, just ask the question. Like I said, it's, it's one of the things we push our team here is to be curious and to understand what, why, you know, we're saying to do things in a particular way. But yeah, don't, don't ever think that any question is too stupid to ask and don't be intimidated by the audience that you're in because if they don't appreciate why you're asking it, then, you know, maybe it's not the right place necessarily for you to be. Yeah, if you ask the same question every day for, for a week, that might be the wrong thing to do, but, you know, ask a question and understand what you're being told and then challenge, you know, challenge the answer. If you're not happy or you don't understand the answer, challenge it. I think that's a big. It's a big thing. It's something I tell, you know, my kids as well. Just don't be afraid to ask a question.

**B** (61:56): Yeah, I was going to say that's valuable life advice in. In general, really, isn't it?

**A** (62:01): Yeah, absolutely.

**B** (62:03): And, yeah, just looking ahead. What's next for Hallward House?

**A** (62:07): So we're definitely now, with all these various accolades, you know, under our belts and these awards that we've achieved, which are great. And now that we're trading stably, which is great as well, considering the journey we've been through, we are definitely keen to, you know, find another property to. To sort of get involved with. It's not going to be easy to find because I think, hand on heart, I've done very, very well. If I just look on paper at this one. And so to even find something remotely that's going to give me this sort of, you know, if I look at it from a purely financial perspective, I don't think I'll find anything to give me this sort of level of return again. But it's been a really. However difficult it's been, and there's been really tough times, it's been a really enjoyable journey. It's been a rewarding journey. I've loved having the people around me that I have around me. They, I think, are still keen to work with me, so I would very much like the opportunity for them to grow with me into another property. And I've looked at a few. I'm not going to sort of name any particular areas, but something that works in close proximity, you know, maybe an hour or so from here would be ideal, but something that I could take all of the learnings from here, here with the team, from here, the senior team, and just roll it out again somewhere else. Obviously, every hotel is different, but the principles of what we've rolled out here should work. And I think that's something I'd like to say. In 12 months, I would have something else under my belt, but, you know, that you have to find something that. That I need, something that sort of sparks an interest in me. I can't just buy something that's for the sake of buying it just because, you know, I think we're in the right time to do it.

**B** (63:57): Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And, yeah, finally, Karim, we finish each Episode with a question left by the previous guest. Our last guest was Pierre Deberau, who's chief administration officer at Accor. And he asked, in moments of uncertainty, what value do you rely on most to guide you?

**A** (64:20): So I, I think honestly, you have to have faith in what you're doing. You have to have faith in yourself and you have to believe that you will make the right decision and the right decision is not necessarily what ends up being implemented, but you know, you will, you will, you will learn through making mistakes. So it's not necessarily going to be the right answer, but it will be another stepping stone towards the right answer. So I think you have to have faith in what you're doing and that you will learn from whatever the outcome is.

**B** (64:59): Yeah, yeah, that's no good, good advice. And finally, do you have a question to leave for our next guest?

**A** (65:08): So I think it would be once you're in, I mean, you obviously have a lot of people, I guess, or different, different, different personalities on, on here. And I think something that I get asked a lot by my kids actually is, I guess because I'm an entrepreneur and it's my, my own business, maybe even someone, if I, if I refer to my, my general manager and, and how she, you know, is very much, you would think that she's invested in the bill, in, in the business is how passionate she is about it. I, they ask me all the time, you know, when are you gonna, when do you think you would retire? Like, at what age? And I, when, at what age do you think you would retire? And I'm thinking, actually, I don't think I would ever want to retire because I always need this, people sort of people pleasing. Not people pleasing, that's the wrong phrase. But I, I always need to feel like I'm doing something good. And I think I can only do that by have being involved in a business. So it's like, actually, do you think you can ever retire from this industry once you're in it, you know that at a senior role and have built in, you know, bought into it that passionately?

**B** (66:32): Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's a great question. And it's a sentiment that we've seen come up with people, you know, it's, people so deeply fall in love with this industry. So, yeah, absolutely. I imagine it's a hard one to leave. Thank you so much for, for joining us. It's been great speaking with you.
