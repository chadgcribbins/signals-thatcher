### 2. So, to kick us off, can you tell us a little bit about your career journey (1:03)

I'm as the most unlikely hotelier in the world, really. I was involved in nightclubs and property development and I thought it was a good idea to open a hotel. My first venture was Edinburgh's first boutique hostel and backpackers hostel. I think there's something to be said for a baptism by fire.


### 3. Not coming into the industry in the traditional sense lent itself to disruptive spirit (5:53)

Not coming into the industry in the traditional sense also lent itself to that kind of having that disruptive spirit. I very much saw staying at a hotel as an experience first and then like, you know, accommodation provider second. And I can see the benefits of coming to the industry with that different perspective.


### 4. You mentioned some lessons learned coming into the hotel industry early on (9:01)

House of Gods is a boutique hotel based in Edinburgh. It opened its first hotel in London, Kip, at Hackney Central Station. When came the moment you knew you wanted to start House of Gods?


### 5. The inspiration for Annabelle's came from heritage properties around the UK (16:18)

The inspiration for Annabelle's came out of all these heritage, these heritage properties around the u. K. And then I was like, I need a name. I decided to call the hotel House of Gods. But I didn't tell anyone.


### 6. Every single part of Edinburgh and Glasgow was built in house by my team (19:33)

Every single part of Edinburgh and Glasgow was built in house by, by, you know, my, the team that I put together. And also there wasn't a playbook, right. Like to an extent with an interior. It feels more like you're actually kind of like chicken into some sort of mad overnight theater than a hotel.


### 7. I've always been intoxicated by these romantic stories about hotels (22:16)

The hotel is called Treat Me Like I'm Famous. Guests get to live like a rock star or VIP special guest for the time that they're there. The hotel is maximalist by design and boutique. People absolutely love it.


### 8. Barney says hotel bars have risen in popularity after COVID (27:34)

Covid very strangely shaped what the brand was. In Edinburgh at the time, nobody would go to a hotel bar for a drink. We created a package called Locked up Me rather than Treat Me. We just played into it.


### 9. House of Gods is opening a new hotel in Canary Wharf next month (33:36)

House of Gods is opening a 79-bed hotel in Canary Wharf. The rooftop will feature a sacred garden. What was behind the decision to open in London? We'd love the brand to go far and wide.


### 10. Have there been any challenges or road bumps on getting the fight ready (38:00)

Have there been any challenges or road bumps on the way to getting the fight ready? "It's all just been plain sailing. There's been no problems whatsoever," says Mayweather. "Give us a few weeks, we'll get this thing open"


### 11. How do you identify the right team for House of Gods hotels (38:35)

How do you identify who's right for House of Gods? I've always had a. strong instinct to employ people that just kind of, like, make you smile. What you can change every single day is how happy your staff are, and therefore the reception that the guest gets.


### 12. Looking back at your journey, what would you say have been some of the biggest lessons (44:08)

House of Gods is opening a new hotel at Canary Wharf in two weeks. What are some of the biggest lessons you've learned about building your own brand? Would love to go on a kind of like rock and roll tour of the world.


### 13. Mike: What's one thing you wished you learned earlier about leading people (46:25)

Olivia Emesi is the CEO of Native Places. What's one thing you wished you learned earlier about leading people and why? Let people discover things for themselves and letting them breathe a little bit.


### 14. Mike: Probably my favorite hotel is coast in Paris (48:13)

Mike: Probably my, my favorite hotel in the world is coast in Paris. What's the hotel that inspired, you know, your journey into hotels? If you're interested in sponsoring episodes of the podcast, drop us a line at podcastotelowner. co. uk.

**A** (1:01): Thank you very much for having me.

**B** (1:03): So, to kick us off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself, your career journey? Because I know you didn't begin in hospitality necessarily, so. Yeah, can you tell us a little bit about. About that?

**A** (1:16): Yeah, absolutely. I. I'm as the most unlikely hotelier in the world, really. I think that, you know, there's. The hotel business is such that a lot of people come through the system. I guess there's such amazing hospitality schools all around the world and people are very well trained and learn everything there is to know about hotels before they ever even think about taking on the ownership or founding a hotel. I did it quite the other way around. I was involved in nightclubs and property development and I thought it was a good idea to open a hotel. So much so that my first venture, which was actually Edinburgh's first boutique hostel and backpackers hostel, I didn't know what a PMS was and I didn't appreciate that you actually had to put people into different beds. So when they checked in on the first day, I just said, pick a bed. And that was an interesting 3 o' clock in the morning on our first opening day, given that we were 100% occupancy, because it was the beginning of the Edinburgh Festival.

**B** (2:21): Oh, wow.

**A** (2:22): Yeah, that was a. It was definitely a baptism of fire. But. But no, I've not had a traditional route into the hotel game.

**B** (2:29): Yeah, I think there's something to be said for a baptism by fire because, you know, you can learn certain things through training courses, but I think if you've got that kind of passion for hospitality. And was that something kind of ignited with your history of nightclubs?

**A** (2:44): Yeah, so like, you know, the kind of origin story is that I looked a bit, I looked quite old for my age when I was about 16 years old. So I was fortunate enough to be able to go one of my few friends that was able to go to nightclubs and bars. So I decided that the smart thing to do was to be to rent these places and put on parties and sell tickets. So I was always, that was my kind of first experience of hospitality, was selling tickets to my friends to go to nightclubs. And I just, I fell in love with hospitality from that moment on. And I went to university under the guise of pretending to learn, but I really just wanted to sell tickets to lots of university students. And that turned into, I think when I was 22, I open to open my first bar. And you know, that was, it was, it was just an incredible experience. And yeah, like I'd never built anything in my life. I had no idea, you know, didn't know anything about point of sale systems or anything. We just bought some booze and, and sold some drinks over the bar and yeah, we just kind of learned everything as, as we went and that, that was pretty successful kind of. That turned into actually a bit of a property development career. Moved away from the bars. And then I think that I've always been really, really interested in how a building or an interior can make you feel much more than, than it's kind of like just basic function, you know, some pretty boring. When I go to, you know, when I go to a restaurant or a bar with you, I'll be like looking at like how the lights are working rather than being engaged in any kind of conversation. So, you know, from, from, from an early age I was really kind of interested in how interiors made you feel. And then as I was kind of, which was like a wonderfully successful career, there's loads more money in that. But I was finding that I was having to build a lot of kind of like very beige homes that would appeal to the mass market, I guess. And I really kind of missed the kind of fun of like creating something new in the way that you can in a bar or a restaurant or a nightclub. And I think hotels just kind of appealed to me because it's like the grown up version of a nightclub. Right. It was like. So I think with the property development experience that I had. You know, we were fortunate enough to. To kind of like, start. Start with that. But like I say, we knew nothing about the business. It just seemed like a really, really good idea. But very strangely, that's actually what's made House of Gods so unique. And I think in some way why it's so popular, because it was never from any kind of rule book. It was just like a, I think, a kind of weird way that I saw the world.

**B** (5:26): Yeah.

**A** (5:27): And I was like, I want to create a brand that, you know, that every part of I would love. You know, throw in a good bit of kind of old world, old world kind of luxury, mix it with a little bit of neon and cocktails, make it fun, make it accessible, and, you know, make sure that all the bits that I pick I would love, and hopefully other people love them too. And it certainly seems to have worked so far.

**B** (5:50): Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Do you think not coming into the industry in the traditional sense also lent itself to that kind of having that disruptive spirit and not sort of feeling constrained by having been in, for example, you know, a corporate framework or.

**A** (6:09): I think, I think absolutely, because, you know, it certainly made it more difficult. We kind of almost learned by our mistakes, but I think that, you know, when you reading something in a textbook and learning it by getting it wrong, you know which way you learn it better. Right. And I mean, I remember early on, you know, like, when we first. We were kind of at that first wave of the PMS is sort of changing to being cloud based, and we were speaking to some, you know, various kind of providers, and I remember there being a conversation with somebody about, you know, and this is when you take out your passport for verification of who you are. I was like, why do you do that? And I think the chap said to me, oh, because everybody does. And I'm like, do you need to. And he goes, I don't think so. And I was like, why would you do it? Right. And I think that there can be a little bit, you know, I think that when something's always been kind of done away, it's hard to kind of change. Right. But because we didn't know, it was quite easy to kind of go, you know, like, let's just imagine it from a different perspective. And because of my experience with. With, I suppose, nightclubs and restaurants and things like that, I very much saw staying at a hotel as an experience first and then like, you know, accommodation provider second. Yeah, Right. So I think the approach is often like, you know, in the hotel Business, I guess it's like we sell beds. I've never ever thought of it like that. You know, that's just, you know, that's just kind of like us making sure that we've got, you know, you know, like in, you know, in a restaurant, that's just like making sure we have got a kitchen. You know, it's. It's about that experience and we just led from experience. And I think that. I think when you. When you take that approach that, you know, that experience can be so much kind of richer and can have so much more to it than if you're kind of originally approached it from a bad perspective. And then you say something like, let's give everybody an experience and then offer them a bottle of wine in their room. Right. So don't wear aunt.

**B** (8:11): Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And, yeah, like you say, it's. I can see the benefits of coming to the industry with that different perspective.

**A** (8:18): Absolutely. And listen, that's just my kind of, like, unique take on it. I'm not in any way slating. Like, there's this. I mean, you know, I always say that my, like, my entire personality is hotels and champagne. Right. It's just. That's what I live for. Yeah. So I'm, you know, I'm the greatest fan of so many, like, hotels and it's something that I just absolutely love being in hotels. They're such a special place, you know, and they've got. So there's such a. There's so much, like, so much of romantic notion around all the great hotels of the world. And I. Yeah, you know, I'm not in any way slating the business overall, but I just. Our unique take on it was the fact that we were able to. Well, we had to look at it differently because we didn't have any choice.

**B** (9:00): Yeah, yeah. And before we really get into House of Gods, you mentioned, obviously, some lessons learned coming into the industry in the earlier days. Can you tell us a bit more about any standout lessons or any funny stories that came from sort of learning through that?

**A** (9:17): So I remember. So I actually, when we built the first place, which was our backpackers hostel, it was our boutique hostel. Right. So I always kind of joke that it was like. It very much has the aesthetic of a boutique hotel, but the energy and vibrance of, like, a hostel. Right. So it's a great place and it's still very, very popular in Edinburgh. It's called the Baxter. Anyway, off the back of that, I got an opportunity to open a hotel, my first hotel in London. And it's a hotel called Kip at Hackney Central Station. And the chap that I ended up developing it kind of with and for, you know, he put a lot of trust in, you know, you know, I remember this thing about Richard Branson always saying, you know, like, you know, just if somebody asks you to do something, just say you can do it and then go work it out, right? And that was very much that. It was 105 bedroom hotel that had to be built. You know, we had to create a brand, we had to like manage it, we had, we had to do absolutely everything and we had like, we basically owned a small backpackers hostel and we'd only had it for six months, right. So I was like, of course we can build a hotel in London, no problem at all. And anyway, moved down to London and I didn't know anything. I remember going to a meeting with one of his pals who was a major hotel investor and him talking about adr and I was like, I had to nip out of the room, pretend I was going to the toilet and look up what ADR means and then try and come and fake it at this meal. And anyway, I remember one of the lessons learned was I've always, I've always tried to work out how we can do things in more cost effective way, right. It's like the nature of like, you know, kind of very much a bootstrapped beginning. And I thought it was going to be a smart idea if we bought some really, really good washing machines to do our own linen for 105 bedroom hotel. Having never ever seen an articulated lorry deliver your linen before, I didn't appreciate quite how much work it was. And I convinced the builders to re plumb the entire building that was half built and put on all this extra water supply. I think it cost like £200,000 and I convinced the builders to do it so that we could put these giant washing machines in and we tried to wash our linen the first day and I was like, right, we're never doing that again. So this like £300 or 2, £300,000 worth of washing machines just basically washed my clothes when I was.

**B** (11:51): Brilliant, brilliant.

**A** (11:52): So, yeah, lesson learned. Yeah, rely on the, on people that can do it better.

**B** (11:58): But like you say, you know, sometimes you, the best way to learn is through mistakes and trial and error. Yeah.

**A** (12:03): Try not to make it a 300,000 pound.

**B** (12:05): Yeah, ideally.

**A** (12:06): Ideally.

**B** (12:09): And yeah, and so like, you know, following the Baxter and Kip, when came the moment you knew you wanted to start House of Gods. Was it just a kind of organic development? Was there a moment of inspiration?

**A** (12:23): There was. There was a couple of things. I. We. We'd open Kip and you know, Kip was. Kip's a. It's, you know, it's a very accessible hotel. It's about. It looks cool, but it's about dropping your bag and going, enjoying the things that are London. So it gets used a lot for like when people are going to concerts and things like that. Right. I always wanted to open a hotel that was much more kind of like, you know, a little kind of a delve into what my mind is like, is like that could really express what I wanted to do creatively. And I'd started to attend a lot of, you know, hotel conferences, as you do. And again, coming back to this experience thing, I was listening to people talking about experience a lot. But, you know, it was a real buzzword at the time and to me it didn't quite have that, the depth. Right. And, you know, some of these beautiful heritage hotels around the world, they can talk about experience, you know, like, you know, they've been built on it, 100 years of it. Right. So I knew I wanted to do something where people got treated really, really well, but was also accessible. And I was kind of working on the idea, but at this point I was living in Hackney, so I was going to Ace Hotel a lot and I was spending a lot of time in Shoreditch House. Obviously it's a Soho House product and the Hoxton of course, so that was very much my vibe. So I think like stripped back concrete floors, whitewashed walls, everybody's super cool. Right. And a lot of flat white.

**B** (13:57): Right.

**A** (13:57): And. And that was my thing and I was going around and so I've always been very, very involved in interiors. And one of the things that. I would also joke that I've got really incredibly strong Pinterest board because I have no formal training. I just quite good at Pinterest and I was going around at the time and as I would do is I would always photograph like, you know, cool interiors that I would see go somewhere cool. That's cool. That inspires me. I'll think about how that could work in my hotel. So I'd taken on this building that was the first House of Gods in Edinburgh, but I didn't really have a concept for it. But I knew it was going to be a little bit like the Hoxton or Shoreditch House. And I was very fortunate to be invited to the opening of Annabelle's in Mayfair and I went along that night not knowing what to expect. I was very, very much the plus one, right? And it was just the most incredible evening. Like, I remember Claudia Schiffer was there and it was like, it was just like I was just, I was so starstruck by being somewhere like that. And as you, you know, it's, I mean, it's a maximalist heaven, right? You go in that place and love or hate it, you've fallen down the rabbit hole, right? It's like if you spend, I mean, if you just buy the most extravagant interior you possibly can, that you can't even imagine what they've done in there, you know, and it was just, you know, I remember it really kind of like, you know, like affecting me emotionally, whether or not I loved it or not. You know, it was just, it was such an experience to kind of go into somewhere like that had too much to drink. Next day I'm wandering around Dalston of all places, trying to find some water and some paracetamol. And I walked into this cool store and I was like, oh, this is cool. This is my aesthetic strip. Back floors, wine boxes with vine tomatoes kind of like falling out the side. And so I grabbed my water, asked for some paracetamol and I went to the counter and I got my stuff and took a picture of the cool concrete counter and I think, you know, that's going to be nice in the. My new hotel. And I walked out and I went, I wonder what, what this place is? And I looked up and it was a spa, right? You know, the convenience sort of Spar. And I was like, my God, if Spar are doing this now, this aesthetics over, right? And, and I started, of course I started to look around. Every coffee shop looked the same, every bar looked the same and all the rest of it. And I was like, I'm only, I'm just going to open another hotel that feels like a version of your house or feels like a version of something that you visit when you go for a coffee or you go for a drink. And then I really got to start to thinking about where the inspiration for Annabelle's came. And it came out of all these heritage, these heritage properties around the uk. If it's from the chinoiserie wallpaper that Chippendale brought all those years ago that adorned the, on these great country houses all around the UK or you know, when you go into some of these old bars and Mayfair and places and you can feel the kind of history in the interiors and you then you look at something like Annabelle's. And it's. It takes all of that, it takes parts of it from around the world. And then, you know, I started to kind of really think about hotels like Blake, you know, where. Or Blake's, rather, where, you know, Anushka Hempos. It was the first, you know, boutique hotel, right? With the four poster beds. And I remember reading stories about how she would, like, could have her grandchildren and they would all jump into the bed and they'd close the curtains and stuff. And I was like, you know, I've never stayed in a four poster bed with curtains. And I was like, I'd really like to. And the whole kind of romance of this started to kind of like occur to me and I started to think about, like, I would love to go on the Orient Express, right? And I looked up how much it cost and I was like, not going on the Orient Express. And I was like, imagine you could create something like this, which takes all this, like, old world luxury and reimagines it with, you know, cocktails, neon, makes it accessible, makes it for. Makes it for everyone, makes it aspirational, but, you know, like, you know, opens the doors to it a little bit. And it just kind of came from there. And then I was like, I need a name. And I always kind of think the names, hotels are pretty badly named, right? On the whole, right? Either you can't understand what the word means, or they're named after a king.

**B** (18:13): Yeah.

**A** (18:13): So it's like I need something a little bit, you know, extra. And I was kind of thinking about all the fashion brands and how that would work. And I'm pretty like, as you can probably guess from this interview, I don't mind the sound of my own voice, right? So I'm pretty much tell everybody every thought that comes into my head. But this one, I had this idea for this thing. I was like, we could kind of call it House of Gods, right? And it's like, you know, because like, everybody would be a bit of a deity, right? And it's like, you know, it's a celebration of the people that come. But then it also sounds a little bit like, you know, the kind of the wonderful mythology around Greek gods and things, it's just so many different levels that it kind of lives on and. But I didn't tell anyone. I said, this is really. I mean, nobody can call a hotel House of Gods, right? It's just stupid, right? So anyway, I decided one day that I was going to have to tell my brother, given that he's My business partner. So I said, listen, let's go for a nice lunch, let's get a train somewhere. Because I knew that he couldn't escape. And I said to him, let's and got this idea for the name. I'm really embarrassed about it, but I'm going to tell you and I'd like to call the hotel House of Gods. And he just turned to me and I think it's absolutely perfect. And you know, actually once I, once he'd said that, it kind of gave me the. It gave me the kind of carte blanche to kind of like really start like developing what that world was in my mind and I just went mad with it.

**B** (19:30): Yeah, yeah.

**A** (19:31): Out popped House of Gods.

**B** (19:33): How was that experience like for you? I guess on the practical level, bringing these ideas you'd collated to actual life and, and particularly with that first site in Edinburgh, what was that process like?

**A** (19:46): I can't lie, it was incredibly difficult. I mean both Edinburgh and Glasgow were like, you know, like it was, they were, that was, you know, you really. There's. Hotels are expensive to build. There's just challenges everywhere. Every single part of Edinburgh and Glasgow, because I come from a building background, was built in house by, by, you know, my, the team that I put together. You know, like I knew if John the plasterer was going to be able to make it on Tuesday because he was out on a. Not on Monday because he was out on a Friday. Right. Like, you know, we were that close to absolutely every, every detail of it and we built absolutely everything, built all the furniture, you know, got all the fabrics, had to kind of like, you know, so. And also there wasn't a playbook, right. Like to an extent with an interior. Like usually what you can do is kind of go right, you know, if you want your house to look scandi, you reference like scandi interiors or mid century tears, whatever you want. And you can kind of find almost like the playbook and you can go to most stores and buy that stuff. Yeah, there is no House of God store. Right. Like, you know, and you can. Stuff can't come from, you know, a normal supplier because then it looks like it's come from a normal supplier. So a lot of these kind of like old country houses and these kind of amazing properties also their interior is a collection of things from around the world. Like I always romance and they amazing interior. It's like somebody got on the Orient Express, picked up some stuff in Paris and then picked up some stuff in Istanbul and that would be what would kind of like, make this maximalist kind of, like, rich interior, so to kind of like, go out and try and recreate that, but then also make it new and, like, hip and, like, you know, like. And pull neon and, you know, like, give it more like, like contemporary cultural relevance. It was just a really difficult, like, you know, I felt we were very much making up the playbook.

**B** (21:45): Yeah.

**A** (21:45): And then to lead with experience. So it feels more like you're actually kind of like chicken into some sort of mad overnight theater than a hotel. Every part of it had to be kind of like, like sculpted and, like, kind of formed and, you know, and a lot of it was just mad loose ideas that had to kind of. We had to kind of get that into resemblance of order and find some way of, like, you know, of. Of welcoming guests and.

**B** (22:15): Yeah. I was going to ask, before we started chatting, of what. What was meant by us or the phrase maximalist by design and boutique and attitude. See, I suppose it's that sort of marrying. Of that kind of eclectic nature and.

**A** (22:30): Absolutely. I think that maximalist by design as well is kind of like, plays into the experience as well. As I mentioned earlier, I've always kind of been, like, intoxicated by these romantic stories of, like, hotels, Right. Because hotels, you know, hotels and celebrity, like, you know, they obviously have this relationship, right, Whereby this is the place that celebrity goes not to be seen, but to, you know, to. To. To have fun. And, you know, hotels, for a lot of people, it's kind of very rich moments in their lives. You know, whether or not it's an encouragement, you know, an engagement or the first time you spend time with somebody, or, like, you know, like. Or like a special occasion or a gift. There's all these, you know, there's. They're really kind of like, rich places, you know, because I love all these, like, rich stories of these. Of these hotels that have, you know, like these kind of rock and roll stories. I don't know, like, people locking in their selves in their rooms for, you know, for, like, three weeks and running up hundreds of thousand pounds worth of bills and all these kind of, like, crazy romantic stories you hear. That was always kind of part of what I loved about the hotel story. Right. And. But that's so inaccessible, you know, it's the reserve of a couple of, like, hotels around the world. And I was like, can we, like, can we kind of create something that makes people feel like they're living in that, you know, and that's what kind of led us to this idea that imagine going and staying at the hotel. But you were the guest, right? Really the guest. Right. And you were given your rock and roll rider, you know, and like, you know, if you wanted only brown M and Ms. Or whatever the story is, you could have only brown M and Ms. So we kind of. I was. I was. When. When we built the first hotel, I was wandering around, around as we were getting near the end, and it was. It was somebody from the brewery, actually, and they just loved the place. Like, the velvet on the walls and everything. And I'm telling all these stories of how cool the place is going to be. And he turned to me and he said, this kind of looks like the hotel that Johnny Depp would stay in. Right. And I was like, I'm liking this. Yeah. So I said, yeah, actually, we're going to have this thing, it's going to be called Treat Me Like I'm Famous and it's going to be like your rock and roll rider. And I just thought of it right there and I was like, kind of basically turned to my phone quickly. That's a really good idea. Write that one down. So when we opened the hotel, we kind of like, you know, because we were leading with experience. Experience. I thought, what better experience than to, you know, to kind of like live like a rock star or, you know, or like, you know, the VIP special guest for the time that you're there. So we created this kind of experience whereby you kind of get all the parts that you would do if you were. If you were invited to, I don't know, Chateau Marmont.

**B** (25:16): Yeah.

**A** (25:16): And, yeah, so you. We, obviously, we throw in a bar tab because rock stars don't pay for their drinks. Drinks. You know, we make drinks in the rooms. We do, like, a very special welcome with, like, you know, chocolates and all the rest of it. And yeah, I think we even. We even, like, send people off with mimosas in the morning, you know, because, like, I mean, you're not. You're not driving yourself. You're getting on your jet. Right. So, yeah. So it's really fun and people absolutely love it. And I think the team really, really embrace it as well. And, you know, we make sure that when people come to stay that, you know, they live that. Right. I mean, so much so that right at the beginning, when we first started, we first started this experience, I would go into reservations and I would say, let me call the next person that's on the. That's. That's taking the treatment like famous experience. And I would say, oh, hi. So. And so it's, you know, we're so excited about you coming to stay. I see that you're on our very special treat me like famous experience. They'd go, yeah, yeah, can't wait. I said, really? This is just a courtesy call to find out what time you're arriving so we can disperse the paparazzi. And like you would just hear the screams down the phone. Right. Like, ah. And you know, it's just, I think you kind of like that just kind of led into what this whole thing became and it's just like, it's just a lot of fun. Yeah, it's just a lot of fun.

**B** (26:34): Yeah. Gosh, I want to do that now. It sounds amazing. And yeah, such a unique idea. I imagine it did of resonate with guests off the bat.

**A** (26:42): Absolutely. It's just. Yeah, it really does. And actually what we find is that, you know, people come to House of Gods for the, you know, like I say, we can be an accommodation solution, you know, like, you know, if you, you want to stay somewhere cool and you've got a meeting the next morning, we can do that. Right. But we get so many people that want to come for, you know, these like, special occasion for those niche like those moments in their lives that are kind of like really special, whether or not it's like, you know, birthday, an anniversary, a gift, I'm sorry, you know, whatever, whatever it is. And you know, and, and we like, we really, we really feel honored that we kind of look after that time. Right. Like I say to the guys all the time, you know, we're custodians of people's most precious time. Right? Yeah, but we like, it's our job. We, we've, you know, we've sold that, that right. We, it's our job to deliver it.

**B** (27:34): And yeah, you know, a lot of people we've spoken to have spoken about the rise of experiential want after Covid in particular. Is, is that something you've noticed or being such a unique offering, has it just always had that sort of COVID.

**A** (27:49): Covid very strangely shaped what the brand was. So when, when we first opened, you know, like I said to you before, we, we've kind of collected the parts of what this brand is on the journey. Barney, you know, I wasn't. There was no, like, there was no playbook. So when we first opened, to go from, to go from living in London where you like, I, you know, quite often on like Saturday night in London, I'll just go, oh, but what hotel bar will I go to? For a drink, you know, and that's because, like, hotel bars are great, right? You know, and there's so many of them. And you can, you know, go to all these incredible bars. And actually, quite often the hotel bars are significantly nicer than just the bar bars. And I guess that's because they've got budget, right? And they can, you know, they can create these, like, you know, more budget guests and then create these amazing spaces. So I'd kind of expected when we opened in Edinburgh, there to be that same kind of enthusiasm to go to a hotel bar. But in Edinburgh at the time, save a couple of places, nobody would go to a hotel bar for a drink, right? Like, nobody in the history of time has ever gone, oh, should we go out for Negronis? Let's go to the Ibis. It's just never, ever happened, right? So we had this situation where we opened a hotel, but we were very much trying to sell the kind of, like, the hotel bar thing, and nobody was interested, right? It was like, it was, you know, it was terrifying. We're like, wow, how's this? Why is this not working like it would work in London? That was six. We opened six months before COVID and then Covid shut us down, which was a little bit scary. And. But in that time, it was quite unique. We were able to. We were able to take 6 months of reviews and insights and look at, you know, and really, like, you know, I've always said that about reviews. Like, you know, like, the bad ones are the ones you really want to read because you can do something about it. And, you know, we just kind of went through all those bad reviews and we had some opinions of our own as well, and there wasn't too many of them. It was still cool. But, like, we were able to kind of, like, look at what we weren't doing, right? And we weirdly had three months of opportunity to fix those things in the first lockdown. So we went out, we. I redesigned the bar completely. We had some very supportive partners that kind of, like, believed in the vision. So I asked them for some money to do it, and they kindly gave me it. And, yeah, we kind of. We kind of. We adapted it almost. And then strangely, when after Cove, when Covid, like, the first part was open and we could sort of open the hotel, yeah, we just. We just played into it. So actually one of the kind of, you know, we took the opportunity in it, right? It was horrendous. You know, it was like, really, really difficult. But, you know, we had to fight for Our fight for our hotel, we were only six months old. The only other option was just closed down forever and it was all gone. So we just had to really fight for it. And, you know, we would like. We had our little war cabinet and we would kind of like, just imagine what we could do. And actually, one of the things that became quite formative to what the brand became was we couldn't open the bar, but we could open our hotel rooms, right? So what we basically did was we created a package called Locked up like I'm famous rather than Treat Me like I'm famous, right? And what we would do is, like, people would come and check in. Now, at the time, you weren't allowed to travel more than like, say, 20 miles, right? So basically, people that lived up the top of the street that were just sick of their own four walls were like checking into the hotel. We were 100% occupancy from the day that we could do this, right? And what we would do is like, check into the hotel and. And we had this what we called the sound system experience. So this is. It was a four cocktail journey through music, right? So you went into your room and you put the. You put this playlist on and you. You would start your journey. We did it all through WhatsApp. And the bartenders would be frantically making all these cocktails in, in. In our empty bar. And then they would run them all to the rooms. So your first one, you would get a knock on the door, right? And we had a big Marshall amplifier and somebody was dressed as Axel Rose. And we had these drinks that looked like they were coming out of a jungle and skull caps and everything. We filled the entire corridor with smoke and we blasted welcome to the Jungle into your room. And like, people opened and remember, you've been locked up for three months now, right? Opened their door to this madness in the corridor. And then we would, like. So they would pretend to be Axl Rose and you get your drinks and then, you know, I guess you have your party in your room and then you would ask for your next one. And the next one was Biggie Smalls Hypnotize. And we actually sprayed fake House of God's Money into the room. The waiters wearing like the, you know, the, the bandana and then the cap and all that sort of stuff. The third drink was Faithless God Is a dj. And we had the glow stick so people could have raves in their rooms. And then we finished it off with A Kiss by a Rose from Seal. And we, you know, we had a rose for. For the guest and it was just really, really good fun. And, you know, what kind of like, everybody talked about it blew up on social media and it. That was part of, like, what formed a lot of the stuff that we did going forward. And, you know, we kind of like, I suppose the bar, the brand just kind of like changed with that. And fortunately, what kind of came out of it was all really, really positive.

**B** (33:19): Yeah, that's, I think, one of the best examples of making the most out of not a great situation. And, yeah, I can imagine, you know, that encouraging, a sort of word of mouth, people telling their friends. It's amazing experience I had. That's brilliant. So, moving on. I understand it's an exciting time with the new Canary Wharf site for House of Gods. So can you tell us a bit about that, what guests can expect and what was behind the decision to open up in London?

**A** (33:51): Well, you know, we would love the brand. We'd love the brand to go, you know, far and wide. So that's always kind of been the ambition. You know, when people have kind of asked, do you think it'll work in so and so, you know, wherever they've suggested, I've kind of said, like, do people like luxury there? You know, it's kind of like, it's an easy sell. London was, you know, is obviously one of the place we really, really wanted to go. And again, it's very difficult, you know, market to crack into. Edinburgh Hotel is 22 bed, Glasgow is 28, and our new one in London, 79. Right. So it's a significant jump. Right. So when basically what happened was Canadian Wharf came to us and they said, we've got a giant gold box that's been built on stilts in the middle of Canary Wharf. Do you want to have a look at? I was like, well, if somebody's going to build a building for House of Gods, it'll be a floating gold box. Right. So I said, I think we better go and have a look at this. And I went out to Canadian Wharf and, like, you know, I said, I've lived in and out of London for, for many, many years, but it's not somewhere I've been a lot. And I went out there and I kind of like, you know, started to see what they'd been doing out there. You know, there's like. I mean, it's a strange. It's, you know, it's very much a changed place. When, when, when I'm leaving now, if I'm leaving Canary wharf at about 6 o' clock in the evening. I'm going against the traffic.

**B** (35:21): Yeah, right.

**A** (35:22): With the amount of people that are coming into Canadian Wharf, you know, there's. I think there's, to memory is there's three and a half thousand people live on. Live on in Canadian Wharf residentially now. That's gonna be 7,000 next year. Every cool restaurant out there now and some of the best sites for, for the brands. You know, there's podcast studios, there's recording studios, there's events and there's just so much going on. It's like this little city, there's loads of creativity going on. And when I saw it all and kind of understood it, I was like, this is just absolutely perfect for House of Gods. We've always been, you know, by the very nature of what we've done and like, because my brother and I bootstrapped it, we never had the options of like, oh, let's just go and get that place on the main street where all the big hotels are.

**B** (36:06): Yeah.

**A** (36:06): You know, we were always. We built a brand that's destination led and, you know, I think we're just very fortunate what a destination we got. You know, it's maybe not the obvious choice, but like, what a destination we got and such an incredible opportunity to, well, I guess just to build a hotel in a big gold box. And one of the real kind of like icing on the cake is the rooftop we have, I think what's going to be one of London's best rooftops. I've created this like sacred garden on the roof. We have one in Glasgow. Basically the idea is that it's based on like a wild rose garden and it just kind of like it's all overgrown and there's like roses, you know, And I basically it kind of goes through that from a lighter kind of pinks through into like the dark heavy reds and greens. And it's almost like a voyage of like night and day and good and evil and House of Gods and it's just really, really fun and I think it's going to be a spectacular rooftop. And you know, when we, when we saw all the things that this hat where like, this is just absolutely perfect.

**B** (37:17): Yeah. Like you say, it's such an interesting up and coming area. It's got that almost sort of dystopian feel, but I think the, the perfect place for a rooftop bar. It amazes me that it hasn't been done before because it's.

**A** (37:30): They've got a few buildings as well. You would imagine there'd be more but listen, I'll take the fact that we're going to be one of the very few. In fact, I think we're the only. Like, we have a retractable roof, so the entire roof, actually, it was built by the same guys that did there with the one in Annabelle's. So it's a retractable roof. It completely pulls back. So, you know, it is properly al fresco in the summer, but also, you know, you can be in this kind of like winter garden in the winter. It's just going to be amazing.

**B** (37:57): Perfect. Yeah, yeah, it sounds lovely. Have there been any challenges or road bumps on the way to getting the fight ready? If so.

**A** (38:07): Oh, no, we're so good at this. It's all just been plain sailing. There's been no problems whatsoever. Of course, you know, it's been, you know, it's been a bit of a wild ride. You know, this is new to us, but, you know, like, everybody's worked really, really hard and, yeah, I think, you know, give us a few weeks, we'll get this thing open and then everybody can come and see for themselves.

**B** (38:33): Yeah, yeah. Exciting times. And we briefly touched earlier on, you know, the teams that you get at the heart of House of Gods. I wanted to ask, how do you identify who's right for. For the brand and how do you get people on board with the sort of storytelling aspect of House of Gods?

**A** (38:53): I've always had a. I've always had a really kind of like, strong instinct to employ people that, like, you know, just kind of, like, make you smile and, like, you know, you just, like, have great personality and. Because I always kind of think, especially in hospitality, you can learn how to use spreadsheets. I don't really care if you can or you can't. You know, you can learn to do that, but it's very, very difficult to teach somebody to smile.

**B** (39:21): Yeah.

**A** (39:22): And that has served me quite well. And I, you know, I think the thing actually, so hotels are really interesting place from. From perspective of feedback, you really, really get, like, you know what you're doing with the hotel, right? You get feedback. I mean, booking.com, for example, has staff comfort, cleanliness, you know, how you're doing. It's very, very obvious. And with a lot of. A lot of properties, you're kind of like, to an extent with some things dealt the hand that you've got. So, you know, if your hotel building is, you know, for whatever reason, is a little bit noisy and very, very hard to fix that. Right. Like, it might be that you might be right in the middle of Piccadilly Circus, it's going to be noisy, right? And there's a few other things, right? Like, you know, especially, like, you know, hotels cost what they cost. You know, like, if somebody's made a bad decision on the color of the walls, you know, aesthetic, you might just get marked down. That's just the way it is. But what you can change every single day is how happy your staff are, and therefore the reception that the guest gets and how welcomed the guest feels and all the rest of it. And then they're going to rate and score how the staff has made them feel. And, you know, I think you can, like, you can. You can make a difference with that every single day.

**B** (40:43): Yeah.

**A** (40:43): And I think that's about, like, kind of looking after your team, respecting your team, inspiring them. You know, I think it's. It's quite, you know, it's fun with house. It's fun brand to be part of, right? Like, so there's an element of, like, you know, we get great people coming, wanting to be with the brand, but then, you know, just make it, like, fun and cool and actually learned it from. I learned it from the first place that I did the. The Baxter Hostel, not knowing how to run a PMS and not knowing that people had to go into serum. I actually forgot pillows as well, but that's another story. But I remember I also forgot to get staff. So I'd just done the night shift, right? Like, I stayed up all night and I was like, right, oh, my God, I've not got any breakfast for anyone, right? So I remember running out and just going and buying scrambled eggs. Now I'm literally the world's worst cook. Well, I haven't even tried. I'm just assuming I am, because if you never try, you're going to be bad. But on the way to the supermarket to run back before everybody got up, I youtubed Gordon, Gordon Ramsay's best scrambled eggs or something. And I watched it, how to make scrambled eggs. And I came back with all these scrambled eggs and I kind of set up shop in the kitchen and I just started making people scrambled eggs on toast, right? And people were coming out to breakfast because I had nothing else to offer. We do scrambled eggs here. I'm an expert. And then I would make scrambled egg and I would hand them these scrambled eggs, and it kind of occurred to me that, you know, and I would speak to them and it was like. It was almost like somebody being in my house as a guest. And I realized that actually that's what it's all about, right? Like, if you approach every guest that comes into, you know, whoever you are in the team, if you approach it with the. Every guest that comes into that house, you just imagine that they're. Sorry. Into your hotel. You imagine that they're a guest visiting your house. And what do you do when you got a guest visiting your house? Your bathroom's never been as clean as was you. You go out and buy the nice toilet paper. You know, you get sausages. So you make sure I've always got sausages in my fridge. You know, you buy the orange juice with bits. You know, you kind of like, you do everything right. Like, and. And I think. And that's. And then from that day, I just start telling the team, imagine they come stay your house. You know, what would you do? You know, would you. Would you leave that, you know, that bed unmade? Or do, you know, you would never do that. And that's where the pride comes from. And, you know, just some things like that and, you know, just start with the right attitude, make sure that. Make sure you're not afraid to do everything yourself. Yeah, I've literally done everything, absolutely everything. I mean, I'm such a control freak, I probably would carry on trying to do everything else if I could, but, like, that's. And actually we've been really, really lucky. So many people, so many of the team have kind of like grown up with the brand and, you know, moved into the different roles that, you know, such. Such an amazing team now that my life is just pina coladas on the beach.

**B** (43:42): Yeah, it's really not, but yeah, that's absolutely wonderful. And it's so interesting what you say about, you know, having that attitude for guests as if you're welcoming them into your home. I guess that's really the essence of hospitality, isn't it? If you think of the fundamental meaning of it. Yeah. And it shouldn't just be a transactional exchange. It should be, yeah, that. That sort of care and pride. So looking back at your journey, what would you say have been some of the biggest lessons you've learned? You know, when it's come to scaling your own brand or. Or building that story and ethos, what. What have been some of your biggest takeaways?

**A** (44:27): I think for me, it's always been about building something that I would want to. To. To stay and. And I obviously, I talked about this earlier lens because it's something that really is something that kind of. I think about all the time. If I'm not going to Be happy staying in it. You know, if it's not, you know, great for me, then it's not great for anybody else. I think that's probably the. The kind of like, guiding star.

**B** (44:54): Yeah, yeah. And what's next for House of Gods?

**A** (44:59): You know, obviously, two weeks time we're building, we're opening like a fairly significant. There's going to be fairly significant moment in the company's history. I think that the great thing about doing Canary Wharf is that it's going to hopefully open the door to the rest of the world. I would love to go on a bit of a kind of like rock and roll tour of the world. You know, I think Dubai is a really obvious place for House of Gods to go. Same with the States. I was recently out in New York speaking some hoteliers out there, and, you know, it would be amazing. So, yeah, get this. Get this one open.

**B** (45:42): Yeah.

**A** (45:43): Prove that we can do it and then speak to some people and see if we can do some deals to take it far and wide, make sure that the guests are still loving it. That's the fundamental. Like I said earlier, the feedback is pretty immediate, certainly with social media now. Right. So we. Let's just make sure we get this one right and then hopefully. Hopefully do some more.

**B** (46:13): Yeah. I mean, you know, it's got such a strong sense of self, the brand, that you can see it transcending, transcending the uk and it will be really exciting to see where it goes.

**A** (46:25): Thank you.

**B** (46:26): And so, finally, Mike, we finish with a question left by the last guest.

**A** (46:30): Okay.

**B** (46:30): The last guest was Olivia Emesi, who's CEO of Native Places.

**A** (46:35): Okay.

**B** (46:36): She's asked what's one thing you wished you learned earlier about leading people and why?

**A** (46:44): I think that. I think that, you know, letting people discover things for themselves and letting them breathe a little bit, you know, I've 100% been guilty of micromanagement. I still very much am, but I'm learning now not to. I think that as I spoke to you before about kind of making the mistakes that kind of helped sculpt what the brand was and not having, not being trained, like overly trained in hotels actually was really where the success was found. And I think when you have somebody in a role and, you know, you know, the playbook. Exactly, exactly how it should be done, and you're watching them do it and you don't let them make their own mistakes, then actually you're not leading. You're just, you know, you're just showing. Right. And I think that, you know, I'VE certainly learned that now is to kind of like to let go of where I need to, to let go and let people discover for themselves. Because, I mean, I don't mean that they're always going to make a mistake. But, but the only way people truly learn things is kind of to understand it for themselves.

**B** (47:59): Yeah.

**A** (48:00): And I think that that's definitely, I don't know if it's a lesson I've actually learned yet, but I'm trying. Yeah.

**B** (48:07): Yeah. It's a tricky one.

**A** (48:09): It's a lesson I'm aware of.

**B** (48:11): Yeah. Brilliant. And finally, do you have a question to leave for our next guest?

**A** (48:17): I am just going to ask, like one that I'm sure has been asked a million times because it's the obvious one, but it's the thing that kind of like makes me, it was kind of what inspired me to do it is like, so I would say probably my, my favorite hotel in the world is coast in Paris. And it's just, it's just beyond cool. And I love everything that Jax Garcia does. And I guess, you know, what's, what's, you know, what's your favorite hotel? What's the hotel that inspired, you know, your journey into, into hotels.

**B** (48:54): Fantastic. And yeah, I don't think we've actually had that question before.

**A** (48:58): So I thought it was going to be.

**B** (49:01): So, yeah, that would be interesting to, to hear what they say. Mike, thank you so much for, for joining us.
