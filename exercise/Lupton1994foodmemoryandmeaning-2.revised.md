Food, memory and meaning: the symbolic and social nature of food events

Deborah Lupton

Abstract

Food preparation and consumption practices are considered integral to the maintenance or deterioration of bodily health. As a consequence, individuals in western societies are regularly exhorted to follow health guidelines in their everyday diets. However many fail to heed this advice. Various reasons have been proposed for lack of behavioural change, but few have fully considered the social function and symbolic meanings of food and eating.

This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study using the innovative qualitative research method of memory-work to uncover the meanings surrounding food practices in developed societies. The data used are childhood memories about food written by students at an Australian university. The memories are examined for common themes and patterns, revealing important aspects of the ways in which food contributes to social relationships and cultural practices. The findings provide explanations for individuals’ adherence to certain eating habits and avoidance of others, and point the way towards the further application of memory-work to elucidate the meanings and symbolic role played by food in western societies.

Introduction

It is generally accepted in medical and public health circles that diet is an important factor in health and ill-health states. Epidemiological research has demonstrated that there is a strong association between the affluent diet consumed by many in western countries and cardiovascular disease, some cancers, osteoporosis, diabetes, dental decay, elevated blood pressure, diabetes, gall-bladder disease and bowel conditions. For example the American

Food, memory and meaning

National Cancer Institute has estimated that on the basis of current knowledge, a minimum of 30,000 lives could be saved in the year 2000 if Americans were to modify their dietary habits, and the Australian Better Health Commission has estimated that over half of all deaths in Australia and one-third of Australia’s health bill are attributable to diet-related disorders (National Research Council Committee on Diet and Health, 1989; Health Targets and Implementation (Health for All) Committee, 1988).

Subsequently many western countries have developed national dietary guidelines to improve health. These stress the reduction of saturated fats, refined sugar, salt and alcohol intake and the increased intake of complex carbohydrates and dietary fibre (for example the guidelines produced by the American Research Council Committee on Diet and Health). Public health discourse is explicit upon the value of the regulated diet to preserve and ensure health. Health education, usually by way of mass media campaigns and social marketing techniques, is routinely used to raise awareness in the lay population about the health risks and benefits associated with the regular ingestion of certain foods and the avoidance of others. Emphasis is also placed upon the need to avoid obesity to preserve good health, itself strongly associated with dietary habits.

However, despite repeated attempts on the part of health promoters to persuade individuals to conform their eating habits to the guidelines laid down by public health bodies, research has demonstrated that many people still resist changing their diet. Some changes in some eating habits have been noted, including trends towards the reduced intake of salt, dairy products and red meat and increased intake of vegetables, in accordance with better levels of knowledge about diet and disease relationships. Yet among some sections of the population in western countries, adherence to an unhealthy diet is still evident (Calnan, 1989; McConaghy, 1989; Backett, 1990; Steele, Dobson, Alexander et al., 1991; McKie, Wood and Gregory, 1993),

Among scholars in the field of health communication and health promotion the explanations provided for resistance to change have drawn mainly upon individualistic behavioural psychology models and theories, such as self-efficacy, social cognitive theory, locus of control, the theory of reasoned action and the health belief model. Their explanatory logic is based upon viewing behaviours such as food preparation and consumption habits as largely rational cognitive choices made freely by individuals.

Such models of behaviour often ignore the limiting effects of social and economic disadvantage upon healthy eating practices. They also fail to take into account the influence of taken-for-granted enculturation processes which shape everyday behaviours such as eating from early childhood. This paper argues that attempts to explain eating choices need to consider the interplay of food, subjectivity and familial relationships in contemporary western societies.

The sociology of food and eating

At the simplest, biological level, by the act of incorporation and absorption of food, we become what we eat. As a consequence, the act of incorporation of food ‘is both banal and fraught with potentially irreversible consequences’ (Fischler, 1988: 279), for it is intimately related to concepts of self and identity. But identity is not linked solely to the organic constituents of food, but also its symbolic meaning. Food may be regarded as the ultimate consumable commodity, which not only serves biological needs, but also acts symbolically to define boundaries between Self and Other and construct a cosmology.

Food and cuisine are basic elements of every culture. Indeed their very banality may be a major underlying reason for the lack of scholarly attention given to the analysis of food and cuisine as meaningful cultural phenomena. In the past decade, however, increased attention has been paid by sociologists in the beliefs and social structures influencing food practices in western society, and the ‘sociology of food and eating’ has become recognised as a legitimate sub-discipline, slowly winning recognition. A number of sociologists investigating dietary beliefs and behaviours have used qualitative depth interviews to elicit data (Murcott, 1982: Pill, 1983; Blaxter and Patterson, 1983; Crawford, 1984; Charles and Kerr, 1986a, 1986b, 1988; Fischler, 1986; Calnan, 1990; Beardsworth and Keil, 1992). Such studies have revealed the ways in which the political, economic and historical context of food production, availability and consumption influences the motivation to incorporate knowledge about healthy foods into everyday habits. Research emphasises that culturally transmitted beliefs and values are as important as structural and psychological factors in influencing eating practices.

The findings of such studies suggest that health promoters need

to confront the issue of who has power over the food prepared and eaten in families and to understand the food beliefs of subcultures within a broader population. They highlight that dietary changes in the context of the family unit are particularly difficult because of the expectations of family members and the need to fulfil ascribed gender and familial roles. For example, some researchers have argued that in the context of the family unit the dominance of men’s preferences over that of women’s is an expression of power: ‘Men, although they do not stir the cooking pot, control to a significant extent what goes into it’ (Charles and Kerr, 1986a: 64). This observation has implications for the degree of agency women have in preparing nutritious meals for their families. Even when they possess good levels of knowledge about the health value of food, women must often bow to the wishes of their husbands in providing regular meals for the family.

It is not only the relationship between wife and husband which influences attitudes towards food, but also the power struggles and role expectations inherent in the mother-child and (less commonly) the father-child relationship. This dimension of food consumption has rarely been investigated by sociologists. However one study, involving depth interviews with French mothers, revealed that for many of the women control over diet was equated with control of the child and assuming the maternal role (Fischler, 1986). For example, women were certain that sugar should be limited in their children’s diets not only because it was deemed to be non-nutritious, but because the children’s eating of sweets represent a threat to maternal authority. The child’s perspective on this issue has not been explored.

The present discussion uses memory as a means of identifying the symbolic meanings of food, to investigate the relationship between social relationships, food preferences and important (and therefore, memorable) events. Memory operates on several levels: personal memory of personal experiences, personal memory of things not experienced (gained from the mass media or discussions with others); social or collective memory (such as Americans’ memory of the John F. Kennedy assassination), and history, or formalised, academic memory (Nerone, 1989). The present discussion focuses upon the first level of memory, personal memory, but attempts to move beyond explanation at the level of the individual to draw parallels between different individuals’ personal memories. Individual memory has traditionally been an area of interest for psychoanalysts and psychologists. In

recent years, the attention of scholars in social psychology, social history and communication has begun to turn towards examining memories as socially constructed phenomena. It has become increasingly accepted that memories are not always individual, but have a social nature (Crawford, Kippax, Onyx et al., 1992). Memory is regarded as a cultural construction which operates beyond the individual level.

The present paper is an attempt to unify notions of individual and social memory in examining events drawn from everyday life. The specific technique of ‘memory-work’, hitherto largely used in the field of social psychology to examine subjectivity and inter-subjectivity, is here adapted to address sociological concerns. It is argued that examination of people’s individual memories serves to reveal the social relationships and cultural dimensions of experiences, events and objects; ‘the power of memory-work lies in deconstructing the taken-for-granted, in questioning the moral order’ (Crawford, Kippax, Onyx et al., 1992: 119). For the project reported here, what is important is the ways in which individual memories, drawn from everyday experiences rather than the ‘significant social events’ recorded by history, share similarities, common themes, emotions and expressive language chosen by participants to describe memories are identified and discussed.

Given that food is an element of the material world which embodies and organises our relationship with the past in socially significant ways, the relationship between food preferences and memory may be regarded as symbiotic. The taste, smell and texture of food can serve to trigger memories of previous food events and experiences around food, while memory can serve to delimit food preferences and choices based on experience. The analysis of memories about food serves to reveal the ways in which our memories of everyday life are socially constructed and patterned, to demonstrate that individual memory of ‘banal’ events and experiences is not simply the subjective property of individuals but is part of a shared cultural experience. Examining memories about food can serve to explain currently held preferences and dislikes, which, due to the symbolic role played by food in all human societies, are not only based upon taste derived from the senses, but from socialisation from earliest childhood. Analysis of memories contributes to the understanding of how practices such as food consumption, preferences and preparation are given meanings which are socially transmitted.

Memory-work

Memory-work is a method of empirical investigation which has some similarities with the analysis of material derived from psychological therapy sessions, where the ‘talk’ between the therapist and the client is treated as potentially explanatory (Kippax, 1990: 93; see also Kippax, Crawford, Benton, Gault and Noesjirwan, 1988; Kippax, Crawford, Waldby and Benton, 1990 and Crawford, Kippax, Onyx et al., 1992). The method has similarities with other qualitative forms of social science research such as life histories, case studies or other narratives in that it requests the respondent to provide her or his own account of an event. However, written memories, according to Kippax (1990: 93), differ from other accounts elicited from respondents in that they

do not offer reasons for action but descriptions of actions and events; the memories are not closed and rounded. They are less likely than accounts to contain our self-delusions, our justifications, our glosses.

It is assumed that events, feelings, emotions, places and people remain as memories because they are in some way problematic and significant; emblematic of great joy or pleasure but also sadness, conflict, anger, unhappiness, frustration and fear. Kippax takes a psychological perspective on memory, seeing memories as central to the construction of self, of subjectivity. However she also sees memories as one of the ways in which individuals appropriate the social world. It is this latter perspective which is adopted for the purposes of this study into memory and food, to uncover the socio-cultural meanings surrounding food. As Kippax (1990: 95) notes, memory-work moves away from asking obvious and direct questions which invite cliched, rehearsed explanations and glib explanations. By requesting a memory which allows respondents to invoke a wide range of memories around a general trigger topic, the choice of memories to recount is telling. Memories allow theorising of everyday events which have been retained for their importance. In the tradition of social constructionist research, the ‘truth’ of the remembered events is not a major issue of importance, rather, the focus is upon the construction of knowledges and the processes by which the enculturation of individuals into a society is achieved,

so that experiences that may seem, to the individual, to be highly personal, are revealed as cultural products.

Methods

For the purposes of the present study, between June 1992 and March 1993 three classes of humanities students at the University of Western Sydney, two from an undergraduate group and the other from a post-graduate group, were asked to prepare a written memory about food. They were given a week’s notice to prepare the memories. The participants were given a handout which outlined the rules of memory writing (derived from Kippax 1990: 94):

1. write a memory
2. of a particular episode, action or event
3. in the third person
4. in as much detail as possible, including even ‘inconsequential’ or trivial detail. It may be helpful to think of a key image, sound, taste, smell, touch
5. but without importing interpretation, explanation or biography.

It is important for participants to follow these rules, so as maximise the heuristic value of the memories and achieve a certain degree of detachment, without seeking at the writing stage to elicit theorising.

The students came to their class the following week with their written memories, and were divided into groups of four or five participants to discuss what they had written. While they were all university students, they comprised a heterogeneous group, including several students from non-English speaking backgrounds. The students were predominantly female (25 out of the total of 35 participants), and ranged in age from their early twenties (the majority of the undergraduate class) to middle-aged. The participants were asked to read their memories to the other members of the small group one by one, and to discuss and compare each other’s memories, looking for the similarities and differences, the themes and the feelings involved. The author moved between groups, discussing individual memories with each group. There was then a general class discussion, similar to a focus

group format, about the findings of each group. The classes compared their findings, with discussion revolving around linking the memories with broader social patterns and the symbolic meanings surrounding food. The two stages of the discussion processes totalled approximately one hour in length, with the author taking notes of the discussions and collecting the participants’ written memories at the end of the sessions.

As it turned out, approximately half the memories featured early childhood experiences, ranging in length from one to two pages of type- or hand-written print. This paper concentrates upon these early memories, in the attempt to explore the common themes and experiences of food consumption at a formative time of the life-cycle in which preferences and rituals around food are first moulded.

Childhood memories of food

Of the sixteen childhood memories collected, several revolved around incidents in which the child was forced by a parent or guardian to eat a food-stuff which he or she did not like. For Paul, his childhood memory of food was unpleasant:

He was about 10 years old. His father was a vegetable fascist, his mother learnt to cook from the soggy vegetable school of cooking. He hated vegetables, particularly peas. It looked like a thousand soggy peas. He tried to hide them in his dressing gown pocket but was caught by the food S.S. The dog under the table refused to eat them. ‘You will not leave this table until you’ve eaten every one of those peas’. Visions of sitting in the same chair until he was 21 years old.

A compromise. The only way he could stomach the peas was to swallow them whole. He then swallowed each pea with a glass of water, like a pill. Gagging on each one.

Gary wrote a memory from an incident when he was seven

which was similar to that of Paul, and involved the same detested vegetable:

Gary turned to his mother and asked why he was given peas as part of his dinner, when she knew that he did not like them.

She answered that they were good for him and he needed to eat them now and then to keep him healthy.

Having no intention to eat them, Gary ate everything around the peas. Finally his mother snapped at him to eat his peas or he was not allowed to leave the table. Gary spooned a few peas into his mouth and heaved as the taste reached his throat, He washed them down with a drink of cordial.

Gary eventually coped with the situation by hiding the peas in

his pocket when his mother’s back was turned, and later flushing them down the lavatory. ‘

Jocelyn also remembered an incident from her childhood involving being forced to eat peas at the usual family Sunday dinner. She remembers feeling particularly upset because she was

kept at the dinner table while the others went to the park. Her grandfather came to her rescue:

Seeing how upset Jocelyn was, her grandfather offered to help her. He quickly gathered her peas into a serviette and threw them into the garbage. Jocelyn was now allowed to go to the

park and to this day remembers the kindness her grandfather showed her on that day.

Janine remembers an incident in which she was being minded by a baby-sitter who insisted that she eat a meal she detested, spaghetti bolognese with parmesan cheese:

Glowing with the yellow powder which had been liberally spread over the meal, it smelt horrible. Glaring balefully at the

woman who had applied the foul-tasting cheese, tears began to fall. She did not want to eat this food.

David recalls an incident involving being forced to eat tripe with white sauce at the age of five or six years:

David can still easily recall the feeling at the time — flat resistance, refusal to eat, utter disgust at such an offering, supposedly as food fit for human consumption. David did not

yell or scream at being forced to eat such tripe, but he did spit it out in revulsion.

As the above memories demonstrate, the emotions expressed in a number of memories tended to involve resentment at being

672 © The Editorial Board of The Sociological Review 1994
Food, memory and meaning

forced by one’s parents or guardians to eat detested food. The participants remembered vividly the feelings of physical revulsion, of almost ‘gagging’ and ‘heaving’ when forced to eat the hated food, of spitting it out, of swallowing peas like pills to avoid their taste. They react emotively by ‘glaring balefully’, by ‘refusal

to eat, utter disgust’, by crying, by hiding the food. The theme of control is evident in several of the childhood memories, that of

parental (or in one case, a baby-sitter) control over the eating practices of the child. Participants vividly recalled the feelings of dislike, anger, resentment and powerlessness which accompanied such eating experiences.

Another memory, written by Jane, conversely involved the use of deprivation of food as punishment. Jane, at the age of eight or nine, had been misbehaving at the dinner table, and was ordered to eat on her own in the kitchen. Having retreated in disgrace,

Jane found the gravy bowl, and proceeded to lick the gravy with her fingers. She was discovered by her father:

Jane’s Dad came in. ‘What do you think you’re doing?’, he roared. “This isn’t a reward, it’s a punishment!’. Jane was defiant in her attitude and claimed she didn’t care. She looked at her Dad. Her Dad looked back. Without breaking the eye contact, she dipped her finger in the saucepan, covered it with gravy, and nervously swallowed it. It still tasted great. Jane’s Dad issued a threat. Jane repeated the action, and realising it was probably her last scoop, made sure she collected heaps of

gravy on her finger. Oops, some of the gravy slipped from her finger and onto the floor. Jane was banished to her bedroom for the rest of the afternoon.

In this memory, Jane’s use of food acts as a prop to establish her refusal to bow under parental authority and punishment. Her continued eating is an act of defiance, just as hiding or refusing to eat disliked food described in the above memories serve as means of countering parents’ attempts to dictate how the child should conduct his or her bodily activities.

While many of the memories involved incidents around the typical family dinner, some described special occasions involving food. Two childhood memories written by participants involved birthday parties held for the protagonist, but in contravention to the stereotype of the birthday party as a time of delirious joy for the child, both memories were largely negative. Lesley remembers

her parents throwing a birthday party for her at around the age of eight or nine to which all her classmates were invited. The party becomes uncontrolled, with food fights, running and screaming. Lesley’s ‘exhausted’ parents tell her later that night that it was the last birthday party they would ever hold and Lesley remembers feeling that ‘somehow, it was all her fault’. For her, the memorable aspect of the event was not the special birthday party food provided by her parents, but her feelings of guilt and disappointment because her birthday party did not conform to the accepted norm.

Susan remembers a rare birthday party held for her, fifth birthday (her parents could not afford many parties). Unfortunately Susan had measles, and was too ill to enjoy the ‘coke [Coca Cola], ice cream, lollies [sweets] and cake’ provided:

The strongest memory of that day is of her standing on the seat of a huge lounge chair, her head in and out of a (sick) bucket watching her brothers and sisters enjoying her party.

In both these memories the emotions of resentment and disappointment are strong. The experiences were remembered because they did not match expectations that childhood birthday parties are magical and special, especially for the ‘birthday child’. The mythology of the magical birthday, for both these participants, had been destroyed and thus entered their memories.

In childhood, food which is out of the ordinary may represent a special treat (as in the case of birthday party food) or else a marker of difference. Another negative childhood memory written by a participant concerned an incident in which the protagonist was made to feel different because of the food she had brought to school. Mina, child of eastern European immigrants, remembers the distinction her lunchtime food drew between herself and her friends at the age of seven. She reacts by rejecting

the exotic food in favour of food deemed ‘normal’ and acceptable by her peers:

Mina was embarrassed to eat around her friends, as what her grandmother prepared was quite different to what her other friends were eating. Janis [her best friend] usually had devon and tomato sauce sandwiches, or vegemite and cheese sandwiches on white bread. Mina thought they looked very appetising to eat. Her grandmother, on this occasion, had prepared a

674 © The Editorial Board of The Sociological Review 1994
Food, memory and meaning

salted (raw) herring, onion and cheese, black bread sandwich. The sandwich looked very unusual and smelled fishy. All Mina’s friends commented on the food as being ‘yuk’. Mina usually loved the sandwich but instead placed it in the rubbish bin, and rushed off to the canteen eagerly to get a vegemite sandwich on white bread. She was hungry, and didn’t want to feel uncomfortable when she ate.

It is notable that Mina’s ‘foreign’ lunch was marked by the inclusion of fish, onion and black bread, all of which are highly unusual foods for young children to bring to school in Australia. Her best friend’s lunch was ‘ordinary’ and bland, but acceptable according to conservative Anglo-Celtic Australian standards of what is considered ‘proper food’. Mina responds by rejecting the foreign food which symbolises her own outgroup status, and embracing the archetypal Australian sandwich: vegemite on white bread (vegemite is a vegetable extract which holds a special place in Australian mythology as a substance that only Australians like to eat; it thus serves as a marker of ‘Australianness’).

For Juan too, the discovery that the food of his native Spanish

culture is ‘different’ leads to his adoption of food which is more ‘Australian’. Juan’s memory dealt with his first entry into an

Australian ‘milk-bar’ (cafe that serves milkshakes and fast-food)

and his first taste of a hamburger at the age of eight, having recently arrived from his place of birth:

As he walked past, he stared inside and recognised how different this food shop was to the days back home. Where food outlets served ‘tapas’ (morsels) with ham, meat balls, assorted cheeses and salads, sardines or fresh fish, Spanish omelets, olives, salami, chorizo, coffee and alcoholic beverages of all sorts and his favourite, ‘tortas’. This place was supposed to serve milk, but in reality it sold hamburgers, fish and chips, shelved tin food and basic necessaries.

When Juan, encouraged by his friend, tastes his first hamburger, he is pleasantly surprised:

as they ripped open their parcels to unfold a warm magnificent looking sandwich filled with meat, salad and some strange-looking red sauce [ketchup], the boys nodded to each other with approving smiles and devoured those foreign-looking

sandwiches. The taste surpassed any ‘tapa’ Juan had ever relished.

For Kristina, another woman from an eastern European background whose family had moved as immigrants to Australia, the ‘foreignness’ of the food rituals she remembers from her childhood serves as a welcome source of ethnic and familial solidarity and cohesion. She remembers that the preparations for the annual Christmas feast take weeks, and involves all members of the family:

Her father scouts big farms weeks before, to select the healthiest pig to be slaughtered. Her mother pickles cabbages months ahead, for her famous cabbage rolls. It takes a lot of precision, On the big day, the whole family gathers and they all catch up on gossip. The women serve the food, clean up and then rest.

The men get drunk on ‘rakija’ (plum brandy) and talk politics,

While such traditional activities around Christmas significantly differ from the Anglo-Celtic tradition of Christmas celebrations and food (which do not feature slaughtering a pig, making cabbage rolls or drinking rakija) — Kristina notes in her memory that ‘This is not your typical Australian barbecue’ — the writer remembers only feelings of belonging, anticipation and happiness at the rituals in which she participates: ‘Kristina is happy to come from a large family and finds that food signifies traditions which must be kept alive’.

Other pleasant childhood memories written by participants often revolved around stays with grandparents or older members of the family. Sally’s memory concerned the use of food in an Easter ritual during her childhood spent in Scotland:

She stood beside her granny watching the eggs being rolled up in cloth. Her granny had put all sorts of pretty flowers next to the egg, mainly yellow and purple ones. Once the eggs were boiled and the eggs were left to cool, the next excitement was the unwrapping of the eggs. Each little egg was more beautiful than the other. Easter Sunday came and there was great anticipation on the way to the woods to roll the eggs. The sky was blue, the trees murmured gently in the breeze. The eggs

tasted better and the yolk was yellower than eggs at any other time of the year.

Elaine’s memory was about a nice surprise her grandfather gave her when she was about three years old:

Telling her to ‘Open wide’, he popped something very strange into her mouth and told her not to bite or chew but to press her tongue hard against the roof of her mouth. She was a bit worried because whatever it was filled up most of her mouth, but as she squashed as hard as she could, suddenly there was an explosion of flavour, texture and fragrance unlike anything she’d ever had before. Her eyes flew open as Grandad twinkled his blue eyes and took one of Elaine’s hands in his hand — the one with the big blue Swallowtail butterfly tatooed on the back. ‘It’s a strawberry, Lill’un — did you like that?’.

Another woman, Mary, remembered the cakes made by her aunt who lived in the country:

Aunty Ann had always done her own cooking and was an expert at many things, particularly sponge cakes and pavlovas. Her sponge cakes were superb, where she used fresh eggs and cream from the farm. The first taste of her sponge cake melted in the mouth, it was light and moist with the slight aroma of egg. The cream and jam in the middle was thick and sweet. Even now it’s hard to find anything near as good as Aunty Ann’s cakes.

while Anna remembered the treats made for her by her grandmother when she was about five or six:

Nana made Anna and her sister little cakes with sultanas, and tomato sandwiches made of white bread, with salt and pepper and the crusts trimmed off. Then they had a ‘picnic’ on the green grass in the backyard. It was exciting, and made Anna feel spoiled and loved. Anna’s mother didn’t believe in letting children have sugar, and never made cakes, and they only had brown bread at home because it was ‘good for you’.

Joanne’s memory evoked the smell and taste of fried potatoes

given to her free as leftovers by the local owner of the fish-and-chip shop:

The smell of the fried tidbits was delicious, the colour golden and the taste hot and crunchy. It was always best in winter when

the sun had dropped in the sky and the afternoons [were] cool. She felt warm, happy and satisfied, especially as it was for free.

These memories use sentimental styles and cliches to recall the happiness of early childhood: ‘the sky was blue’, ‘trees murmured gently in the breeze’, ‘Grandad twinkled his blue eyes’, ‘the first taste of her sponge cake melted in the mouth’, ‘the green grass’, ‘the colour golden’. In these memories, the nostalgia of a perfect world is evident: ‘The eggs tasted better and the yolk was yellower than eggs at any other time of the year...’. The memories are rosy and replete with detail, and the pervasive emotions conveyed are those of excitement, security, delight and being loved. It is significant that three of the memories involve grandparents and the other an older relative: traditionally members of a family who indulge their young grandchildren, nephews or nieces with treats, sometimes to the disapproval of their parents who attempt to maintain certain eating regimens at home (as in Jocelyn’s memory recounted earlier, in which her grandfather helps her to dispose of her hated peas).

Discussion

The childhood memories of food recalled by the participants were strongly linked to familial relationships. Although the participants in the memory-work exercise were requested to write about ‘food’, not ‘meals’, interestingly, many memories centred around formal meals, particularly dinners, rather than breakfasts, lunches, snack, confectionary or ‘junk’ foods. Most of the negative childhood memories written by the participants were characterised by incidents occurring for the most part in the immediate family and involving a regular family meal. The context in which the food event occurred was thus not generally unusual or exotic, although sometimes remembered because of the special occasions of Easter or birthdays or visits to relatives, when treats were provided. It is also enlightening that few of the participants (with some notable exceptions) dwelt in their memories upon the tastes, texture or appearance of food. Rather, those elements of the memories which were pronounced were the emotions recalled by the participants. The event was generally not remembered for the unusualness of the food itself, but for the social relationships around which the food was consumed.

Food, memory and meaning

This choice implies that the participants overwhelmingly interpreted the word ‘food’ as ‘a family food event’ a trend which can be related to the concept of the ‘proper’ meal which has been defined as cooked, hot food served as the main meal of the day and eaten with all the family gathered around the dinner table (Murcott, 1982; Blaxter and Patterson, 1983; Pill, 1983). Murcott argues that regardless of its nutritious value, such a meal is viewed as the most appropriate to provide to the family because of its symbolic value, which stands for ‘the home itself, a man’s relation to that home and a woman’s place in it’ (1982: 693). In the memories reproduced above, the ‘cooked dinner’ (also referred to as the ‘roast’ or ‘cooked dinner’ in Australia) made several appearances among participants of Anglo-Celtic origin. In Jane’s memory she notes that ‘It must have been a special occasion, since the meal itself was one of her mother’s roast dinners — a tried favourite with Jane’, while Jocelyn noted that ‘Once again Jocelyn was faced with her usual Sunday dinner. This was usually a baked dinner, which contained peas’.

The childhood memories reproduced above were characterised by the emotional themes of control, disappointment, security, happiness and belonging/not belonging. The memories tended to invoke feelings of either resentment or delight. The feeling of lacking control, of being the powerless partner in the parent-child relationship was evident in several memories, as was the emotion of pure, nostalgic pleasure linked with close family ties, particularly indulgent grandparents. It is noteworthy that control is an important dimension identified by feminist scholars who have commented upon the growing importance of dietary control for women in western cultures. Although constant dieting and, in its extreme form, the health-threatening conditions of anorexia nervosa and bulimia, are most overtly associated with advertising images of attractive and sexually desirable women as thin, at the deeper level the constant self surveillance and obsession with diet displayed by many women in western society represents the attempt to manifest control over one’s destiny (Chernin, 1985; Caskey, 1986; Orbach, 1988; Banks, 1992). So too, the parent-child relationship is characterised by a struggle for power in relation to the bodily habits of the child. The similarities of some of the memories elicited by the participants quoted above centring around parental authority during meal-times demonstrate the shared cultural experiences surrounding eating practices, even among participants with an age-gap of over two decades and of different sexes.

The exertion of dominance on the part of the parent, most commonly the mother, is partly exerted ‘at the site of the eating habits of the child. The child’s ingestion of forbidden substances, such as confectionary, represents a challenge to maternal authority (Fischler, 1986), while the relaxing of these rules is significant, serving to mark out special events (birthdays or treats) or different familial ties, such as those between grandparents and grandchildren. Rules around food within the family context serve to mark the boundary between acceptable and non-acceptable behaviour. Parents’ attempts to shape their children’s food consumption habits, including table manners, may also be regarded in the wider context of the enculturation of the young, in which the rules of ‘civilised’ behaviour are established and maintained. The child learns what food is considered appropriate to eat and what is not and how to eat it as part of his or her entry into the social world. As Fischler (1986: 950) observes, for parents, ‘control over the child’s diet is vital. Not only is the offspring’s present health at stake, but his [sic] whole future evolution, his entire person’.

In childhood as well as adulthood, food is inextricably interlinked with group membership as well as kinship. The memories of participants of non-Anglo-Celtic ethnicity quoted above serve to demonstrate the importance of food as a marker of ethnicity. Food is instrumental in marking differences between cultures, serving to strengthen group or national identity and to distinguish Self and Other. Each nation has its national dishes, and in many countries, each region its special cuisine, by which it identifies itself and is identified by others. In his collection of essays analysing French popular culture, the semiotician Barthes singled out for attention the nationalist properties of certain foods, noting, for example, that chips, the common partner of steak, are the ‘alimentary sign of Frenchness’ (1989: 71). So too, wine is regarded by the French as a ‘totem drink’ of Frenchness, “a possession which is its very own, just like its three hundred and sixty types of cheese and its culture’ (Barthes, 1989: 65). Food and culinary practices hold an extraordinary power in defining these boundaries: those who eat strikingly different foods or similar foods in different ways may sometimes even be thought to be less human (Mintz, 1986).

An important part of the civilising process is learning the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ food. As a result, the struggle between parents and children often centres around the discourse

of ‘good’ food versus ‘bad’ food, where the former is defined by parents as vegetables, meat and milk and the latter as confectionary and ‘junk-foods’. Eating ‘good’ food as appropriate is virtuous, and civilised. ‘Bad’ food does not feature regularly at family meal-times, but is associated with out-of-the-ordinary events. Thus, Gary’s mother tells him that even though he dislikes peas, ‘they were good for him and he needed to eat them now and then to keep him healthy’, while Anna delights in the white bread sandwiches and little cakes made for her by her grandmother because ‘they only had brown bread at home because it was “good for you”’, and Mina is embarrassed by the foreign food her grandmother considers is “good’ food, but which does not conform to the norms of the playground.

In western societies, where notions of adult self-control and morality are strongly linked with body shape and food consumption, exploring the early experiences of people with food serves to throw light upon the ways in which food practices are imbued with meaning. It is noteworthy that the childhood memories of food here examined did not raise issues of guilt or the need for personal control over food consumption, emotions that might be expected to be associated with adult experiences with food given the current cultural obsession with dietary self-control. ‘Bad’ food was associated not with ‘bad feelings’, but with feelings of being indulged and loved. It was ‘good’ food which was most problematic (and therefore memorable) for participants, linked as it was to conflicts with parents and strong feelings of physical revulsion.

The cultural prescriptions for what is considered ‘good’ or ‘bad’ food and the latent emotional and social meanings associated with these categories have enormous implications for attempts on the part of health educators and public health promoters to change the dietary habits of individuals by appealing to rational, commonsense arguments, and explain why ‘bad’ food habits persist despite these efforts. All food inhabits a moral space. Confectionary is nutritionally ‘bad for you’ but is conceptually ‘good for you’ in its connotations of pleasure and enjoyable wickedness: ‘naughty but nice’ (James, 1990: 679). Food morality dictates which categories of food are acceptably nutritious and thus virtuous to consume, but in the very categorising of ‘bad’ and guilty foods, serves to render such foods more desirable, giving them the status of rewards. The typical pattern of rewarding children with sweets for good behaviour or puddings

after eating the ‘good’ food reproduces the categorisation of foods, which is carried into adult life when confectionary is used to console oneself at times of stress or crisis (James, 1990: 681-682).

The findings drawn from these childhood memories therefore provide some explanation for food preferences demonstrated in adult life. They demonstrate that moral or rational criteria in making food choices may be superseded in some cases by the baggage of previous experiences with and around food, the collection of past feelings, tastes and social relations which have lent meaning to particular foods or food events. The study suggests that dietary beliefs and behaviours are not only biologically and economically determined, but are formed as a process of socialisation throughout early childhood and adolescence, culturally reproduced from generation to generation, and are also the product of individuals’ experiences with the social relations connected with food events.

Conclusion

Unlike other qualitative methods of eliciting memories such as case-studies, focus group discussions and depth-interviewing, memory-work allows people to evoke experiences and feelings without being specifically directed by an interviewer. The effect of some experiences may be at the level of the subconscious so that individuals would find it difficult to articulate them in a direct interviewing situation. In memory-work, when the topic of the memory remains general and the source of the memory is left to the participant rather than being consciously evoked by an interviewer there is a greater scope for heterogeneity of response. It is therefore all the more significant when individuals produce memories that have similar themes to those that others have written. Memory-work is a collective enterprise into social investigation, but it also, in its initial stages, involves a solitary pursuit; the writing of a memory. Memory-work may thus serve as action research, in that it involves participants beyond the level of acting as ‘subjects’, requiring them to engage with the processes of qualitative social research, and thus dissolving the distinction between ‘researcher’ and ‘subject’.

In the use of memory-work here described, the process of recalling and writing down a memory served to bring into focus

the important social and emotive character of food events, and in broader terms, to highlight the complexity which underlies taste and preference choices related to everyday practices. The findings have demonstrated that this method offers potential in eliciting some latent and unelicited beliefs, attitudes and feelings about food which may not emerge using alternative methods of research. As a learning experience for the students who participated, the discussion of memories involved them in a collective theorising exercise, requiring them to move beyond their individual memory to the social nature of food events and thus enhancing their understanding of the socio-cultural nature of everyday life activities. Further research using the process of memory-work to understand elements of everyday life such as food consumption and preparation can build upon these initial findings, perhaps by using topics to trigger memories such as ‘breakfast’, ‘good food’, ‘bad food’, ‘special food’ or ‘cooking’. However, it should be noted here as a caveat that while the method tends to be successful among middle-class participants with high education levels, the method may be difficult to use with people who do not possess the required level of literacy to write memories, or who may find the writing and collective theorising processes difficult or confronting.
