Transcript:

Interviewer: Thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us today, Noreen. I know you spent several years at the Beverly Wilshire. Can you tell us a bit about what it was like working there?

Noreen: Of course. The Beverly Wilshire is... it's a theater, really. And I don't mean that dismissively. It's a carefully constructed stage where everyone plays a role. I was part of the front-of-house cast, so to speak. I wore the costume - Hermès or Ferragamo scarves, tailored suits, heels - presenting this image of sophisticated accessibility. But the reality? I was making $13 an hour.

Interviewer: That's quite a contrast. How did you reconcile that?

Noreen: You learn to inhabit the role. The mandate was impossible but clear: their wish was, in fact, my desire. You have to make guests believe that fulfilling their requests is your greatest joy, regardless of how you actually feel. It's emotional labor in its purest form.

Interviewer: Can you walk us through your typical day? How did the operation actually work?

Noreen: We had incredibly detailed guest profiles - dossiers, really. They tracked everything: preferences, allergies, personal details, past complaints, favorite drinks. The system enabled what I call "manufactured familiarity." Before a regular guest even arrived, we'd have their car warmed up, directions printed to their usual destinations, their preferred beverage sent to the room. It felt personal to them, but it was systematized.

Interviewer: So it's all documented and tracked?

Noreen: Absolutely. The hotel maintains comprehensive records. It creates this seamless experience where recognition feels genuine despite being entirely manufactured. Guests loved it - they felt seen and known. Which, in a way, they were. Just through a very corporate lens.

Interviewer: What were some of the more memorable requests you handled?

Noreen: Oh, there were many. One that stands out - a Saudi princess named Sara. She had stayed at a JW Marriott in Madrid and became obsessed with how it smelled. She wanted her palace in Jeddah to smell exactly the same.

Interviewer: Wait, she wanted you to recreate a scent from another hotel?

Noreen: Exactly. I had to do detective work, calling the JW Marriott's marketing department, learning about the scent marketing industry - which I didn't even know existed. Eventually, I sourced the exact fragrance, complete with commercial diffusers and monthly subscription service. We shipped it to Saudi Arabia.

Interviewer: That's incredible problem-solving.

Noreen: That's the job. Other requests? Mariah Carey wanted massage therapy through the night - all night, rotating therapists. Someone wanted carpeting installed in their bathroom because they didn't want to hear their heels clicking on the tile. I helped select sunglasses for Prince once. The requests ranged from reasonable to absurd, but you treat them all with the same level of seriousness.

Interviewer: How did you handle the more... unusual requests?

Noreen: You become resourceful. You build networks. The concierge community is actually quite interconnected - there are professional organizations, informal networks. If you can't solve something, someone else in the network probably can. The key is never saying no. You find a way, or you find someone who can find a way.

Interviewer: You mentioned front-of-house versus back-of-house earlier. Can you expand on that?

Noreen: This was actually the hardest part for me, emotionally. There's this rigid hierarchy. The "back of house" employees - housekeepers, custodians, drivers - they work in deliberate invisibility. They're essential but treated as if they shouldn't be seen. Front-of-house staff like myself inhabited this ambiguous middle ground. We were visible, we were the face of service, but we were still service workers.

Interviewer: How did that affect you?

Noreen: Over time, it became disturbing. I'd have these warm interactions with guests - genuine warmth, sometimes - but the structural inequality was always there. I was wearing a designer scarf while making barely more than minimum wage. The housekeepers who cleaned those rooms made even less and were expected to be invisible. It started to feel damaging to my sense of self.

Interviewer: What did you learn about the guests themselves? What were they really seeking?

Noreen: I think everyone - guest, visible worker, invisible worker - ultimately seeks the same fundamental thing: to be seen and to be heard. The irony is that the hotel creates this elaborate machinery to make guests feel seen, while simultaneously requiring certain workers to remain unseen. The guests were often lovely people individually, but they existed in this bubble where the machinery of service felt natural, invisible itself.

Interviewer: Did you notice patterns in what different types of guests wanted?

Noreen: Absolutely. The ultra-wealthy guests often wanted experiences that couldn't be bought off a shelf - hence the scent request, the impossible reservations, the custom everything. They were used to being able to acquire anything, so the challenge became creating something unique. Middle-tier luxury guests often wanted validation - they wanted to feel like they belonged in that space. They'd ask for recommendations in a way that sought confirmation they were making sophisticated choices.

Interviewer: How much autonomy did you have in problem-solving?

Noreen: More than you'd think, actually. The hotel trusted experienced concierges to make decisions, spend money within reason, call in favors. They understood that empowering us to say yes created better guest experiences than requiring approval for everything. There was an implicit budget for "making things right," and we were expected to use it judiciously.

Interviewer: What about situations where you couldn't deliver?

Noreen: Rare, but they happened. The key was managing expectations early and offering alternatives. You never just said "no" - you explained the constraints and proposed three other options. Usually one of those worked. And if something truly went wrong that was our fault, we'd go overboard on compensation. A bottle of wine, spa credits, sometimes comping an entire night's stay.

Interviewer: Looking back, what do you think the Beverly Wilshire did really well?

Noreen: The systems were impressive. The attention to detail, the documentation, the training. They had refined the luxury hospitality experience to a science. Every interaction was choreographed, every contingency planned for. It worked, objectively. Guests loved it.

Interviewer: And what would you change?

Noreen: The inequality. The way back-of-house staff were treated. The wages across the board, honestly. You can create this incredibly sophisticated guest experience while also treating all your workers with dignity and paying them fairly. Those things aren't mutually exclusive. The theater of luxury hospitality doesn't require actual poverty backstage.

Interviewer: That's a powerful observation. Last question - what surprised you most about the role?

Noreen: How much of myself I had to perform away. I went in thinking I'd be helping people, solving problems, being creative. And I did those things. But I didn't expect how much I'd have to suppress my own reactions, my own judgments, my own sense of fairness. You become a mirror that reflects back what the guest wants to see. That's valuable for them, but it takes a toll on you. The best concierges I knew had very strong senses of self outside work. They needed that boundary to survive the role.

Interviewer: Noreen, this has been incredibly insightful. Thank you for being so candid about both the operational excellence and the human costs.

Noreen: Of course. I think it's important to talk about both. The Beverly Wilshire creates extraordinary experiences. But we should acknowledge what - and who - makes that possible, and what it costs them.
