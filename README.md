# Signals - Thatchers Demo Project

This repository contains materials for demonstrating the Signals software using hospitality stories, interviews, and trend research for the Thatchers demo.

## Contents

- `memories/stories.md` - Collection of memorable hotel experiences shared by team members.
- `memories/stories-synthesis.md` - Synthesis of the memory stories.
- `customer interviews/` - Interview source files (DOCX + Markdown) and anonymized Markdown transcripts.
- `trends/` - Curated trend reports organized by category; includes PDFs and web-extracted Markdown files for LLM ingestion.
- `signals/` - Platform and prompt system overviews.
- `meeting notes/` - Demo planning notes and transcripts.
- `synth-concierge/` - Synthetic concierge input used for the demo.
- `archive/` - Archived materials (including prior context briefs).

## Purpose

This repo supports a Signals demo for Thatchers using a fictional hotel use case. The data mix combines:
- Real hospitality memories and long-form interviews (with anonymized versions)
- Trend research from multiple sources
- Synthetic role-based inputs (concierge/marketing) to enrich the knowledge base

Signals can then synthesize insights across these sources to surface patterns in guest experience, service quality, and market trends.

## Getting Started

1. Review `memories/` and `customer interviews/` for qualitative inputs.
2. Review `trends/` for market and technology context.
3. Use Signals to analyze and extract insights across multiple knowledge bases.
