# Signals Platform Overview (Non-Technical)

Signals is a workspace for designing and running AI-powered workflows end to end. It helps teams turn messy inputs into structured outputs by organizing work into repeatable steps, tracking progress, and keeping everything tied to the workflow that produced it.

## What it’s for

- **Designing AI-driven workflows** for research, analysis, and content synthesis.
- **Managing inputs and outputs** as first-class artifacts (files, notes, generated results).
- **Running and refining workflows** over time, with clear status and iteration history.

## How it feels to use

You create a workflow, give it a name and description, and then build it out on a visual canvas. Each node on the canvas represents a step in the process—like collecting source material, generating drafts, or synthesizing insights. You can open details for each node, see its inputs, view generated outputs, and adjust specifications to improve results.

## Core capabilities

### 1) Workflow management
- Create, rename, and delete workflows.
- View each workflow’s status and details.
- Edit workflows on a visual canvas.
- Select a preferred iteration when reviewing outputs.

### 2) AI steps built for knowledge work
- **Knowledge Curation**: Ingest files or sources and organize them into usable knowledge items.
- **Framework Specialist**: Provide structured methodological guidance for analysis or transformation.
- **Strategic Synthesis**: Combine insights into cohesive outputs (e.g., briefs, summaries, plans).

These steps are designed to be repeatable and composable, so teams can standardize how they turn raw inputs into polished deliverables.

### 3) Artifact and iteration tracking
- Every file and generated result is stored as an artifact.
- Iterations are tracked so you can see what changed, when, and why.
- You can re-run or refine steps without losing history, and select the version you want to use downstream.
-- Outputs are designed to stay traceable to their inputs.

### 4) Background processing
- Jobs run asynchronously, so long-running AI tasks don’t block the UI.
- The system keeps track of job status and updates the workflow as outputs are ready.

## Who it’s for

Signals is designed for teams doing repeatable, high‑value knowledge work:

- Product and strategy teams building research briefs
- Ops teams automating internal knowledge workflows
- Analysts and researchers synthesizing large document sets
- Anyone who needs a structured, traceable way to go from input → insight

## In short

Signals turns AI workflows into a managed, repeatable process. It brings together a visual workflow builder, structured AI steps, and artifact tracking so teams can go from raw inputs to trustworthy outputs with clarity and control.
