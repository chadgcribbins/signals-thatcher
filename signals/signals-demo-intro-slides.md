# Signals Demo Introduction
## For Thatchers Team

---

## Slide 1: What is Signals?

**Transform the way you engage with consumer insight**

Signals helps you detect weak signals hidden in noise—making insights real by connecting across documents, exploring strategic implications, and seeing old data in entirely new light.

**The Simple Idea:**
Connect your knowledge → Apply strategic lenses → Generate actionable insights

---

## Slide 2: The Challenge We're Solving

**Getting from data to insights takes too long**

❌ Manual analysis and writing for every new angle
❌ Knowledge scattered across agencies and projects
❌ Teams feel disconnected from the thinking
❌ Only see outputs, not the logic
❌ Effort is duplicated, connections are missed

**Signals changes this:**
✅ From weeks of synthesis → hours
✅ From external agency ownership → embedded team capability
✅ From scattered knowledge → connected intelligence

## Slide 3: How Signals Works
### Three Agents Working Together

**1. Knowledge Bases** 📚
Upload any research—transcripts, interviews, reports, trend articles, brand documents
Organized by source, methodology, or any logical grouping

**2. Lenses** 🔍
Apply strategic frameworks to interpret your data:
- Innovation frameworks (Jobs-to-be-Done, Outcome-Driven Innovation)
- Behavioral frameworks (COM-B, Fogg Behavior Model)
- Service design tools (Journey Maps, Service Blueprints)
- Strategy frameworks (Kano Model, Blue Ocean Strategy)
- Custom lenses you create

**3. Synthesizers** 🧠
AI agents that connect dots across thousands of data points
See patterns humans miss while maintaining nuance and context

**The Magic:** Connect multiple knowledge bases through various lenses to generate insights you couldn't see before

## Slide 4: What You'll See in Today's Demo

**The Hospitality Use Case**

We've built a fictional hotel scenario using real hospitality research:

**Knowledge Bases:**
- Team member hospitality memories (authentic personal stories)
- Customer interviews (anonymized real interviews)
- Concierge perspectives (from lifestyle hotels)
- Hospitality trend research (2024-2026)
- Acme Hotels brand book (fictional luxury food-focused brand)

**What we'll explore:**
- How Signals connects patterns across these different sources
- How strategic lenses reveal hidden insights
- How synthesis generates actionable implications
- How you can interrogate the data in real-time

---

## Slide 5: Why This Matters for Your Team

**Collaborative Discovery**
Your team directly interrogates data, tests hypotheses in real-time, proves validity of strategic direction

**Speed to Understanding**
Weeks of synthesis → hours, without sacrificing depth

**Depth of Insight**
Uncover non-obvious connections by examining data through multiple lenses simultaneously

**Confidence in Decisions**
Validate findings through parallel analyses with comprehensive evidence

**Actionable Clarity**
Move beyond "interesting insights" to clear implications for strategy and innovation

---

## Slide 6: Today's Demo Flow

**What We'll Walk Through:**

1. **The Knowledge** - Show you the hospitality research we've loaded
2. **The Lenses** - Demonstrate applying strategic frameworks
3. **The Connections** - Watch Signals synthesize across sources
4. **The Insights** - See actionable outputs generated
5. **The Interrogation** - Ask questions and explore in real-time

**Remember:** This is early-stage technology being developed with select innovation leaders. Today is about possibilities, not polish.
