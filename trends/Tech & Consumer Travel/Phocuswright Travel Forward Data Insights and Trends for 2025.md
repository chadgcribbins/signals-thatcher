e Digital travel adoption across regions: The
consistent rise in bookings in all areas
highlights a growing consumer preference for
online travel services. This trend reflects a
continuing shift toward digital platforms,
encouraging travel providers to improve their
online booking experiences to remain
competitive.
e 2024 marked a year of solid global growth in
the travel sector, with strong performance in
APAC and steady gains in North America and
Europe. The Middle East and LATAM continue
to emerge as significant markets, albeit much
smaller than the three regional powerhouses.

impact on travel payment strategies.
2. Join working groups such as the European Central Bank's workstream dedicated to developing the
digital euro scheme rulebook and requirements.
3. Assign a team or individual to become educated on CBDCs, track their progress and contribute to a
strategy for CBDC acceptance based on overall market acceptance.
