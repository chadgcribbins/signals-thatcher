**Key takeaways from the research**

There will be an increased desire for **authentic**, **off-the-beaten-path **experiences

**Sustainability** will be an even bigger priority

A blend of **wellness** and **adventure** will drive travel choices

We’ll plan trips around **nocturnal**, **nature-based** activities

**Family values** will hold more importance

Trips and experiences will need to cater for **diversity**

In 2025, travellers will throw the rulebook out of the aeroplane window, rejecting traditional expectations around age, gender and what a typical holiday should look like.

With popular norms left firmly in 2024, there’ll be a growing focus on personal growth and meaningful experiences. From baby boomers taking on thrill-seeking adventures to men prioritising mental well-being on men-only retreats, travel is becoming more about self-discovery and deep connections.

Booking.com’s research highlights how people want meaning from their travel and a greater sense of purpose at the heart of each trip they take. It’s almost like the age-old saying, “It’s not the destination, it’s the journey”. Here’s a closer look at the top trends shaping the future of travel.

No, this isn’t just another way of saying we’ll all be taking red-eye flights in 2025 or that we’ll be holidaying in nightlife hotspots and partying until dawn. The trend of ‘Noctourism’ (nocturnal tourism) refers to travelling to experience the night in all its glory.

‘Noctourism’ will see travellers seeking out dark-sky zones with unprecedented enthusiasm to marvel at the solar system and engage in things like stargazing activities. And it’s not a handful of us, either – over 60% of the people we asked said they were considering visiting destinations with limited light pollution as a way to inch closer to the cosmos.

But this trend has another motivation – the weather. As global temperatures continue to rise and the heat of the day becomes uncomfortable for many (61% of respondents said they wanted to spend less time in the sun), especially when it comes to visiting crowded tourist traps, people will increasingly plan their trips around destinations that offer activities during cooler evenings and early mornings.

Across both city and rural destinations, ‘Noctourism’ will see existing attractions extending their opening hours to cater for changing visitor preferences (museum lates, for example) alongside a host of new experiences springing up to meet demand (organised stargazing tours, night markets, and opportunities to witness once-in-a-lifetime cosmic events).

Okay, maybe achieving immortality is a slight stretch, but the intention remains true. In 2025, we’ll stop seeing wellness as just being about yoga and green juice, setting our sights far higher than before.

Our data shows we’re set to enter a period where longevity retreats take centre stage (60% of respondents reported an interest in this type of travel), with travellers planning health-focused trips around experiences designed to extend their lifespan.

These breaks will see the popularity of cutting-edge experiences like red light therapy, cryotherapy and stem cell treatments spill over into the travel industry as people seek wellness breaks that offer long-term benefits beyond in-the-moment relaxation.

Going forward, travelling will become far less time-bound as we begin viewing our physical and mental health as the ultimate journey.

Gender norms and expectations are becoming increasingly fluid, and this shift is set to extend into the travel industry as well.

With growing societal awareness around male mental health, men-only retreats focusing on wellbeing and personal growth will become more prevalent in 2025.

Nearly half (47%) of travellers would encourage the men in their lives to go on a men-only trip, with this number rising to 65% for Gen Z and 58% for millennials. These trips are a response to the pressures of modern life, with 29% of men seeking rest, 23% prioritising mental health benefits and 14% looking to tackle feelings of loneliness through these getaways.

Our research suggests we’re growing less fond of “lads holidays”. Instead, we’re refocusing on our health and seeing travel as the perfect opportunity to ground ourselves with time to reflect.

AI stands for artificial intelligence but will also stand for ‘alternative itineraries’ as we move into 2025.

With this trend, we’ll see a fusion of the two – people using powerful AI tools (such as Booking.com’s AI Trip Planner) to craft alternative itineraries for themselves based on personal preferences and the needs of the destinations they hope to visit. These itineraries will be bespoke and encourage far deeper connections with both local communities and the planet more broadly.

This doesn’t mean that traditional travel agents are a thing of the past or that independent research into local experiences and opportunities will become obsolete; it just means that people will begin using a wider range of tools when planning their travels.

The changing use of technology doesn’t stop at the planning phase, though. It also comes into play when we look at the data around how people choose to use things like social media while travelling.

Our data reveals that nearly half (44%) of travellers will refrain from tagging locations in their social media photos to prevent masses of so-called ‘Instatourists’ from descending and ruining the ambience.

Kids, you might want to stop reading now…

The trend of Spending Kids’ Inheritance (SKI) is set to continue in 2025, as nearly half of travellers (46%) would prefer to spend their money on a trip of a lifetime rather than leaving an inheritance. This trend is particularly strong among baby boomers (49%) and the silent generation (40%).

It’s not all bad news for the youngest members of the family, though. Multigenerational trips will rise in 2025, with 58% of travellers admitting their parents have paid for part or all of their holidays. These family trips will prioritise shared experiences over material wealth, with 80% of boomers happy to fund their children’s and grandchildren’s holidays.

If you think that the thrills and spills of travel are reserved only for the younger generations, it’s time to think again – adventure has no age limit!

Linking to the previous trend of multigenerational trips, we can see a parallel growth in appetite amongst older travellers to reignite the passions of their youth.

In 2025, baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) are redefining what it means to travel later in life. 23% of the people we asked (up from just 10% in 2024) said they’re interested in high-octane adventures like skydiving, canoeing down the world’s largest rivers and trekking across mountain ranges.

It’s clear that the spirit of adventure and pushing ourselves outside our comfort zones are on the up alongside shifting perceptions of what growing old actually means. Age is just a number, and there are no time limits on embracing adrenaline-filled experiences like horseback riding, downhill skiing (actually on the slopes this time) and hunting for remote glaciers.

Travellers with neurodivergent needs are calling for a more inclusive approach to travel, and 2025 is set to see significant progress in this area.

Almost half (49%) of neurodivergent travellers who took part in our research said that they have had a negative experience due to their needs, and 50% believe their travel options are limited due to a lack of inclusivity.

Next year, technologies like AI-powered tools for real-time updates and sensory-friendly environments will help address these issues. 66% of neurodivergent travellers are keen on AI assistance, 68% request sensory rooms and 74% call for more noise-cancelling options in airports and hotels.

Sustainability and careful budgeting are key focuses for 2025, and one trend reflecting this is ‘vintage voyaging’.

Embracing a thrifty or vintage mindset when travelling isn’t just about finding a bargain, though. It’s about immersing yourself in a place's history and heritage. These trips treat the experience of travelling as a souvenir in itself, with holidayers seeking to enjoy deeper cultural connections with the destinations they visit by rejecting globalised consumerism and choosing to shop locally instead.

Over half (51%) of travellers are interested in buying their holiday wardrobe at their destination, with this figure rising to 63% among Gen Z. Thrift shopping and vintage stores are becoming a core part of the travel experience, with 73% of travellers having already purchased second-hand items while abroad.

2025 is set to be the year that the airport takes its place in the limelight as travellers actively seek out destinations with the [best airports](https://www.booking.com/articles/best-us-airports.html).

We all know that a poor airport experience can leave a sour taste in the mouth before or after a trip, so this trend marks a shift towards people working to make the most of their holiday from the moment they leave their homes.

Airports that offer far more than security checks and duty-free shops will allow us to transform the time between [checking in](https://www.booking.com/guides/article/flights/complete-guide-checking-in-airport.en-gb.html) for flights and boarding the plane, adding real value to the overall travel experience from the start.

In fact, more than a third (34%) of travellers are interested in visiting a destination based on its airport, with Gen Z and millennials driving the trend. Among younger travellers, 43% are keen to embrace indulgent airport experiences like sleep pods (37% of Gen Z), spas (31% of Gen Z) and Michelin-starred restaurants (22% of Gen Z), turning layovers into luxurious pre-trip experiences.

Booking.com’s 2025 report highlights a collection of diverse and exciting destinations set to capture travellers' attention next year. These locations offer a wide range of experiences, from serene beach getaways to cultural hubs and adventure-filled landscapes. Here’s a look at the top spots that will be at the top of everyone’s lists in 2025.

As these trends gain momentum, travel in 2025 marks just the beginning of a more thoughtful, intentional approach to exploring the world. Travellers are no longer satisfied with traditional, cookie-cutter experiences. Instead, they are seeking journeys that defy conventions and align with their personal values – whether that’s sustainability, wellness or cultural immersion.

Looking ahead, we can expect technology to further revolutionise how we plan and experience travel. AI-driven tools and neuro-inclusive innovations will make holidays more adaptable, ensuring all travellers feel catered to. Additionally, the growing focus on wellness suggests that travel will increasingly be seen as a tool for long-term self-care rather than just a brief escape.

As family dynamics evolve and the impact of climate change becomes even more apparent, the destinations and experiences that matter most will continue to shift. The demand for responsible, regenerative travel will likely rise, pushing both travellers and the industry to rethink how we engage with the world around us. The future of travel is about forging deeper connections – personal, cultural and environmental – and how they shape the way we explore in years to come.

**METHODOLOGY**

Travel Predictions 2025 research commissioned by Booking.com and conducted among a sample of adults who plan to travel for business or leisure in the next 12-24 months. In total, 27,713 respondents across 33 countries and territories were polled (including 1,016 from Argentina, 1,002 from Australia, 502 from Austria, 1,003 from Belgium, 1002 from Brazil, 1,006 from Canada, 1,007 from China, 1,005 from Colombia, 501 from Croatia, 501 from Denmark, 1,011 from France, 1,009 from Germany, 1,004 from Hong Kong, 1,002 from India, 506 from Ireland, 501 from Israel, 1,014 from Italy, 1008 from Japan, 1,013 from Mexico, 1011 from The Netherlands, 1003 from New Zealand, 504 from Portugal, 508 from Singapore, 1004 from South Korea, 1,008 from Spain, 509 from Sweden, 500 from Switzerland, 507 from Taiwan, 1,009 from Thailand, 503 from the UAE, 1,012 from the UK, 1,006 from the US and 1,016 from Vietnam).
