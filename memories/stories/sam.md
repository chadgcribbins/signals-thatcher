# Sam

It was a cold wintry January night; Sam had just finished his split shift working at The West Bay Hotel where he and his partner Tess were the tenants. Romy, their daughter, was asleep in her bedroom. Tess, who at this time was four months pregnant, had tried to wait up to greet Sam but had fallen asleep as well. Sam quietly crawled into bed to get some well-earned rest.

All three, deep in sleep, were startled by the fire alarm raging. Startled, Sam sprang from the bed and checked his watch: 2:38 a.m. Quickly thinking, have we got any planned fire alarm tests? As he walked along the old creaky landing of their flat above the pub, Sam investigated Romy's bedroom only to his horror to see a bright orange glow coming from outside of her window.

Sam shouted for Tess and told her to get Romy and get downstairs to the assembly point. Sam's mind was racing at 100mph; first thing he had to manage was the guests staying in the hotel. He had four couples staying in the hotel, so he needed to get them up and out of their rooms. Considering the shouting, banging on the doors and the fire alarm, one room was still not answering the door. Sam had no option but to get the keys from the bar to get into the room. The orange glow now gathering momentum and panic setting in, Sam managed to get into the room only to find there was no one inside.

In a frenzy, Sam ran outside to the assembly point whilst calling the fire brigade. Worried about these two guests, Sam performed a head count; to his amazement they were all present and accounted for. The couple had been quick when they heard the alarms going off and had seen the fire notice on the back of the door and made a swift exit.

Fire crew now onsite, they identified the tumble dryer was the culprit! After all the madness Sam had become rather embarrassed as he had now realised, he was stood in the car park on a freezing cold night in January wearing nothing but Tess's dressing gown!
