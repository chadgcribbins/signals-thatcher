# Paul

As the plane from Bristol touched down at Vaclav Havel Airport, Paul peered through the airplane window, watching delicate snowflakes swirl beneath the floodlights. It was 9 p.m., Prague's winter night had settled in, and the unfamiliar noises of a new country filled his ears as he stepped onto the tarmac. Paul's breath clouded in the cold, and a flutter of nerves mingled with excitement. He'd never set foot in the Czech Republic before, and now he was here, starting a new adventure for FSC, ready to lead a project that could shape the next chapter of his career.

The Holiday Inn Prague Airport was just a short walk from the terminal, its modern glass facade glowing invitingly through the darkness. Inside, warmth and soft lighting replaced the chill, and the friendly receptionist greeted Paul in fluent English. The lobby's open design felt both futuristic and welcoming, a gentle reassurance that he could find comfort even far from home.

As Paul checked in, he felt a surge of anticipation. The room was spotless, with a room service menu and blackout curtains promising a good night's rest. Yet, as he unpacked, Paul couldn't help but feel the weight of responsibility. He was here not just as a visitor, but as a representative from the UK, tasked with building new relationships and navigating unknown territory.

Looking out of the window at the snow-dusted surroundings with a Shell forecourt glowing magnificently on the airport access road, Paul realised that every journey begins with a single, uncertain step. Tonight, Prague was a blank page, and he was ready to write the next chapter of his story.
