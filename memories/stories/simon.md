## A Roaring Adventure: Our Night with Lions

What started as an ordinary week quickly turned into something unforgettable. Simon had a milestone birthday coming up, and his wife insisted he book Friday off. Simon wasn't a fan of surprises, but curiosity won--and by Thursday, the secret was out: a trip to the West Midlands Safari Park and an overnight stay in the Lion Lodge!

The excitement was electric. The kids thought it was just a day at the safari, and Simon loved keeping the surprise under wraps. Spring had draped the day in a light drizzle, but nothing could dampen the thrill of seeing exotic animals up close. The family laughed, answered endless questions about zebras and rhinos, and even braved rollercoasters in the afternoon. But as the drizzle turned to steady rain, spirits began to dip--until the big reveal.

Back at reception, Simon and Carmen dropped the bombshell: "We're not going home tonight... we're staying in the Lion Lodge!" The boys' faces flickered between delight and dread. "Is that safe?" they asked nervously. Simon wasn't entirely sure himself!

The gates loomed ahead--massive black wrought iron, swinging open like the entrance to Jurassic Park. Rain lashed down as they hurried along a stone path to a rustic wooden door. The air smelled of damp wood and wild animals. Inside, the lodge was pure magic: warm, dim lighting, authentic safari decor, two cozy bedrooms, a lounge, and an outdoor swing--all framed by floor-to-ceiling windows looking straight into the lion enclosure.

Dinner was waiting, bags neatly placed, and Simon cracked open a perfectly chilled cider as the family explored. Outside, lions lounged lazily, but every so often, a massive predator would stroll past the glass--just inches away. The boys shrieked with excitement as golden eyes locked onto them through two inches of glass. For a moment, it felt like the lions were sizing them up for dinner!

Night fell, and with no curtains, the enclosure melted into darkness. That's when the real show began. The lions came alive, their thunderous roars shaking the night air. Simon and his family sat wide-eyed, listening to the primal symphony until sleep finally claimed them in broken intervals. Now they understood why lions nap all day--they party all night!

Morning brought a knock at the door and the heavenly aroma of fresh bread and a cooked breakfast. As they savoured their meal and watched these majestic beasts one last time, reality crept back in. But the memory of that night--the thrill, the awe, the closeness to nature--would stay forever.
