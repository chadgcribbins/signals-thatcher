# Simon R

Simon remembered the pool at Ariyasom Villa as the quietest place in all of Bangkok. It sat tucked beyond the bustling streets between the villa's teak buildings and the lush garden, where the late-day light softened everything it touched.

One evening, after hours spent navigating the city's crowded streets, he got into the pool just as the sun had begun to set. The water was warm from the day's heat, and the surface reflected the sky as it shifted from gold to soft pink.

Palm leaves rustled gently overhead. The distant hum of Bangkok drifted over the villa's walls, but it felt muted, almost like it belonged to another world. Simon floated from one side of the pool to the other, watching the sun sinking behind the trees and the old wooden buildings.

As dusk settled in, lanterns around the garden flickered on, casting warm halos across the water. He stayed there until the sky deepened into evening, letting the calm of the moment settle around him.

When he finally stepped out of the pool, he wandered to the small terrace beside it, a quiet platform with a few tables overlooking the water. The air was warm, the night calm, Simon sat and enjoyed a beer, the perfect way to close a day in a hidden corner of Bangkok.
