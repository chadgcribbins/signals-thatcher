# Izzie

As Izzie walked towards the hotel in the blistering midday heat, she climbed the steps to the hotel entrance where huge glass doors slid open, allowing her to step inside into the cool air-conditioned foyer. Dragging her suitcase across the white marble reception floor, Izzie looked around at the large colourful abstract paintings that stood out against the neutral-coloured walls. Soft chairs and sofas were positioned for guests to wait and relax; huge potted plants added a touch of greenery against the stark decor.

Ahead of her, a queue of people were waiting to be checked in, their bags and suitcases gathered around them.

As Izzie stood in line, waiting her turn, her eyes were drawn to the huge windows overlooking the outdoors. Beyond the glass, the sky was a vivid blue, not a cloud in sight. The sun was beating down on a large, oval-shaped swimming pool; its crystal-clear water was occupied with children, laughing as they played, splashing around. Music drifted through the air as adults relaxed, some chatting with drinks in hand, others stretched out on sun loungers, eyes closed soaking up the rays from the mid-afternoon sun. Izzie thought how relaxed and carefree everyone looked. It all looked so vibrant.

As Izzie edged closer to the reception desk, she noticed a pale blue pool bar. Not far from it, a little boy stood red-faced, tears streaming down his cheeks, his eyes fixed on the empty cone clutched in his small hand. At his feet lay a melting puddle of pink ice cream. For a moment, it seemed as though no one noticed. Then suddenly, a woman hurried over and replaced the ice cream. The boy's tears slowed, and as the new ice cream was placed in his hand, a wide grin spread across his face.

As Izzie stood watching, she was suddenly aware that the queue had moved and it was her turn to be checked in.
