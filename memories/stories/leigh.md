# Leigh

The smell of freshly cooked bread wafted through the room as Leigh settled onto the bright fabric chair for her breakfast. The waiter, dressed in smart attire, greeted her with a latte the same as he did every morning after her first visit. She wandered over to the buffet to see the array of vibrant, delicious fresh food that was on offer: fresh fruit, locally sourced, a real treat; and fresh bread made in the kitchen that was still warm, so the butter instantly melted once put on.

Upon returning to her table, she felt the warmth on her back as she took her first bite, thinking to herself that this is what life should feel like.

In the background she could hear the early morning swimmers in the pool gently splashing around while they did their laps before the pool got invaded by morning aerobics, something Leigh always participated in but only in the afternoons as the day's sun warmed the pool up, so it was not a shock to her system when she got in.

Not wanting to move from this moment, Leigh steps away from the table and thanks the waiter as she heads back to her room to get ready for a blissful day that awaited her, hours of lounging on the golden beach with the sun glistening on the water.
