# Philip

Philip took a deep breath, and the door lock clicked open with a jolt. It was always the moment he feared most when entering a hotel room and didn't have a good feeling about this one. He braced himself as his wife and son entered the room.

Just moments earlier, they'd made what could only be described as a celebrity entrance. The staff had been giddy with excitement; apparently they had never had a Brit stay before. Even his driving licence had caused hilarity, and as for their accents... It was like royalty had descended into the indiscriminate place just off Highway 59, Mississippi.

The next moment felt inevitable - the smell hit first, a fog of damp fused with the synthetic citrus of LemGel cleaning agent failing to smother the aroma. The stains on the sheets conjured up images that made him shudder. Not to mention the array of dead insects that looked like they'd fought a good battle, and lost. The fallout began. The walk of shame with heavy bags in tow, back past the receptionist who continued to wave sweetly, back to the red Chevrolet in the parking lot and back to the open road knowing that 3.4 on booking.com could never, ever, be set as the benchmark again.
