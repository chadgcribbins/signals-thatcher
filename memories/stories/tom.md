The hotel room in Brisbane smelled faintly of salt and old carpet, as if the river air had soaked into the walls and never quite left. From the narrow window, the city glowed in patches--office lights still burning, the dark ribbon of the Brisbane River barely visible below. Near the door, propped awkwardly against the wardrobe, was a cricket bat he had brought for no clear reason other than habit.

The trouble began after midnight, when a sudden thud echoed from the hallway, followed by the scrape of something heavy. The silence that followed was thick, deliberate. He reached for the cricket bat, fingers tightening around the handle, then the unmistakable rush of water. From the bathroom came a sharp crack, like tiles shifting under pressure.

When he pushed the door open, the light flickered, revealing water spreading across the floor. Emerging from the bathroom doorway was a shark! He raised the bat instinctively, breath shallow, pulse roaring louder than the river outside.

Eventually, the water stopped, the corridor remained empty, and the shark was nothing more than a grotesque decoration knocked loose by a burst pipe. But he did not sleep again that night. Even as dawn washed Brisbane in pale heat and traffic noise, the cricket bat stayed in his hands, and the image of that lifeless, watching eye lingered long after he checked out.
