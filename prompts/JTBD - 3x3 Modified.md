Modifier Definition — Functional, Emotional, and Cultural Lenses

Definition

The Functional–Emotional–Cultural (FEC) Modifier is an extension to the canonical Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) framework. It decomposes each job into three distinct analytical lenses — functional, emotional, and cultural — across the dimensions of capabilities, opportunities, and motivations. This produces a structured 3×3 view of each job, enabling richer understanding and more precise innovation opportunities.



Core Principles





Parent–Child Relationship





The Modifier does not replace the canonical JTBD definition.



It acts as an addendum: every modified job must first conform to the base JTBD rules (motivations, opportunities, capabilities, outcomes).



The Modifier then enriches the job through additional lenses.



The 3×3 Structure

Each job is analyzed across three dimensions, through three lenses:





Capabilities: What the person can or cannot do.



Opportunities: The situational enablers or constraints.



Motivations: Why the job matters to them.

Each of these is examined in three lenses:





Functional (practical tasks, resources, and utility).



Emotional (feelings, confidence, psychological states).



Cultural (norms, values, identity, social expectations).

This creates nine analytic cells for every job:





Functional capability, opportunity, motivation



Emotional capability, opportunity, motivation



Cultural capability, opportunity, motivation



Outputs Fromat





For each canonical JTBD statement, the Modifier produces a 3×3 grid of insights.



Example:





Functional capability: “Knows how to batch, freeze, stretch a base.”



Emotional opportunity: “A well-stocked kitchen is emotional insurance.”



Cultural motivation: “Wants to feel and be seen as steady and dependable.”



Guardrails





Each modifier insight must map back to the canonical job statement.



The Modifier does not create new jobs; it enriches existing ones.



The Modifier ensures outputs are systematically structured and comparable across jobs.



Visual Format Requirements for Modified JTBD Asset

1. Overall Structure





The asset is built around a single JTBD statement at the top, followed by a structured 3×3 grid of modifiers(functional, emotional, cultural × capability, opportunity, motivation).



Layout reads top-to-bottom:





JTBD statement (full sentence, centered or top-aligned).



Modifier cells, arranged in three vertical columns (Cultural, Emotional, Functional) and three horizontal rows (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation).



2. JTBD Statement





Placed at the very top, spanning the full width of the asset.



Written in the canonical form:

“When [situation], help me [action/goal], so I can [desired outcome].”



Formatting:





Font weight: bold.



Position: centered or left-aligned at top.



Spacing: clear separation (whitespace) before the modifier grid starts.



3. Modifier Grid (3×3 Matrix)

Columns (Lenses)





Three vertical columns:





Cultural (left column)



Emotional (center column)



Functional (right column)

Each column contains three stacked blocks (capability, opportunity, motivation).

Rows (Dimensions)





Three horizontal rows, running across the columns:





Capability (top row)



Opportunity (middle row)



Motivation (bottom row)

Each row contains one block per lens, aligned horizontally.



4. Individual Cell Structure

Each of the nine cells (Cultural capability, Emotional opportunity, Functional motivation, etc.) follows a consistent micro-format:





Label:





Bold, followed by a colon.



Example: “Emotional capability:”



Content:





1–2 sentences maximum.



Plain, declarative style.



Focused on describing the lens/dimension intersection.



Example: “Feels frazzled and behind. Wants small wins that restore order.”



Spacing:





Each cell clearly separated from others (line breaks or boxes).



Content aligned under its label.



5. Reading Order

The matrix should be read top-to-bottom within each column or left-to-right across rows. Both must make sense.

For example:





Reading down one column: Cultural capability → Cultural opportunity → Cultural motivation.



Reading across one row: Cultural capability → Emotional capability → Functional capability.

This dual readability ensures clarity.



6. Visual Styling





Background: white or neutral.



Borders: optional, but light dividers or column spacing help clarify the grid.



Typography:





JTBD statement: bold, slightly larger.



Labels (“Cultural capability:”) bold.



Explanatory text: normal weight.



Whitespace: generous padding around each cell for clarity.



7. Example Mapping (from your image)





JTBD Statement (top):

“When I come home from a stressful day, help me make something I can eat for a few days so I feel calmer and ready for the week.”



Grid Cells:

Row 1: Capability





Cultural capability: “Grew up amid uncertainty: climate, economy, public health…”



Emotional capability: “Feels frazzled and behind. Wants small wins that restore order.”



Functional capability: “Knows how to batch, freeze, stretch a base.”

Row 2: Opportunity





Cultural opportunity: “Pre-prepping and feeling prepped for the week has become more common.”



Emotional opportunity: “A well-stocked kitchen is emotional insurance — a way to feel ready.”



Functional opportunity: “Needs flexible formats: one product, three roles.”

Row 3: Motivation





Cultural motivation: “Wants to feel and be seen as the person who’s steady and dependable.”



Emotional motivation: “Wants to feel quietly competent and in control. Would love to get a helping hand or head start.”



Functional motivation: “Feel secure and self-sufficient, without starting from scratch.”



Modified JTBD Statement

A Modified Job to Be Done is a canonical JTBD statement that has been extended through a structured analysis of capabilities, opportunities, and motivations across functional, emotional, and cultural lenses. This produces a 3×3 matrix of insights that enrich understanding and support consistent generation of innovation opportunities.



Intended Use





Enables consistent generation of richer JTBD insights from qualitative or quantitative data.



Guides LLMs to parse interview transcripts, survey data, or corpora and output structured 3×3 “Modified JTBD Assets.”



Creates a repeatable and rigorous method for comparing jobs across teams and contexts.



Sources and Positioning





Extends Christensen’s canonical JTBD framework (Competing Against Luck, 2016).



Aligns with behavioral science models that emphasize capabilities, opportunities, motivations (Michie et al., 2011).



Incorporates cultural analysis to reflect identity, norms, and systemic factors in food, health, and beyond.
