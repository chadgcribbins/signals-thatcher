Document A: Canonical Definition of Jobs to Be Done (JTBD)

Definition

Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding human behavior and innovation. A “job” is defined as the progress an individual seeks to make in a given circumstance. People “hire” products, services, or solutions to complete these jobs. Success depends on how well the solution enables the person to achieve their desired outcomes.



Core Components





Job Statement





Expresses the job in a structured format:

“When [situation/opportunity], I want to [goal/motivation], so I can [desired outcome].”



Motivations (Why)





The underlying drivers for wanting to get the job done.



Includes functional goals (utility, efficiency), emotional goals (feelings, confidence), and social goals (perception, belonging).



Opportunities (When, Where, How)





The contexts and circumstances in which the job arises.



Defines when the need is felt, under what constraints, and in what environment.



Example dimensions: time pressure, social setting, boundedness (snack vs. meal), or time of day.



Capabilities (Can/Can’t)





The skills, knowledge, and resources an individual brings to the job.



Defines what the person can realistically do, and highlights gaps that solutions must bridge.



Desired Outcomes (Success Criteria)





The ways individuals measure whether a job was completed successfully.



Typically stable over time, even if solutions change.



Examples: save time, reduce effort, improve accuracy, feel more secure.



Forces of Progress (Adoption Dynamics)





Push of the current situation (frustration with the status quo).



Pull of the new solution (promise of improvement).



Anxieties (concerns about change).



Habits (inertia of existing behavior).



Canonical JTBD Statement

A Job to Be Done is the progress an individual seeks to make in a specific circumstance, shaped by their motivations (why), opportunities (when/where/how), and capabilities (what they can or cannot do), and evaluated against desired outcomes (how success is judged).
